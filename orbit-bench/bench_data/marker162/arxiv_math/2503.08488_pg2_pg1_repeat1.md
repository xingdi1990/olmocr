## 1 Introduction

In the present paper, we are interested in the phase transition at the critical inverse temperature of the XY model on the three-dimensional square lattice.

To formulate the problem we start by considering a finite subset of a three-dimensional square lattice

$$\mathcal{L} = [-L, L]^3 \bigcap \mathbb{Z}^3. \tag{1.1}$$

On this lattice the Hamiltonian is defined as

$$H\_{L, \nu} := -\sum\_{k, l \in \mathcal{L}} J\_{k, l} S\_k \cdot S\_l \tag{1.2}$$

and v = + or 0. Here, depending on the location of the site k, Sk E St satisfies different conditions: the lattice is decomposed into two parts,

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}^o \cup \partial \mathcal{L},\tag{1.3}
$$

with L° being the interior, and OL = {{z1,22,23} | max{|21|, |22}, |23|} = L} the boundary; for k E L°, the only requirement for Sk is that |Sk| = 1; when k ∈ oL i.e. it is on the boundary, we consider two boundary conditions: when v = 0, we use the free boundary condition, specifically

$$S\_k = 0,\text{ if } k \in \partial \mathcal{L};\tag{1.4}$$

when v = +, the plus boundary condition,

$$S\_k = (1,0)^T,\text{ if }k \in \partial \mathcal{L}.\tag{1.5}$$
