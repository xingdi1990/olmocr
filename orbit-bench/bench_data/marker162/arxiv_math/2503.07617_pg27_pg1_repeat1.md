mesh size h = 1/40 and on a very fine temporal mesh 速 = T/800 with T = 5. The data assimilation algorithm is performed over the same spatial mesh size and on a coarser temporal filtering steps 速 Filter = T / N tFiler where = 50, with the same assumption on the observational operator as in Test Case 2. Since concentration transport is driven by the Darcy velocity, we assume that there are some uncertainties in the process of solving the Darcy's flow system to increase the complexity of state estimation. Thus, we add a small perturbation 50arcy = 0.0001ep to the reference Darcy velocities with Enarcy ~ N(0, I) and input the disturbed velocity to the forward solver. The reference Darcy velocity field and one example of the perturbed velocity field are shown in Figure 29 on a very coarse mesh for the purpose of illustration. We can see that even with a small amount of noise, the perturbed Darcy field is significantly chaotic, which makes the task of state estimation challenging.

Similar to Test Case 2, we aim to investigate the performance of the United Filter under various levels of perturbation. Thus, we consider two types of disturbed noise w in (14): 01 = 0.001 / 速eiler 2 and 02 = 0.1 / 速piler2, where et ~ N(0,1) for i = 1,2. Regarding the setting for the parameter estimation, as the exact values are small, we apply the assimilation algorithm to approximate p; = 1/d; i = 1,2 and p; = 1/a.. We choose the number of Direct Filter particles to be M = 40, and the number of iterations in the United Filter to be R = 4.
