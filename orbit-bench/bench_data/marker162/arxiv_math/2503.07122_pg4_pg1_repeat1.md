Assumption 1.5. The growth functions () is such that the associated generalized modulus of continuity yo : [0, +00) -> [0, +00) is continuous, where

$$\varphi\_{\Theta}(s) := \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } s = 0, \\ s|\log s|\Theta(|\log s|) & \text{if } 0 < s < e^{-d-1}, \\ e^{-d-1}(d+1)\Theta(d+1) & \text{if } s \ge e^{-d-1}. \end{cases}$$

Indeed, yo is the modulus of continuity of the force field given that the macroscopic density is Yudovich, which is enforced by Assumption 1.4 (see Crippa, Inversi, Saffirio and Stefani |4, Lemma 1.1 and Assumption 1.3)); as explained in [4], the value e --- in the definition of yo is essentially irrelevant and included solely to make yo more appealing. Under Assumption 1.4 and Assumption 1.5, one can define weak solutions f to (VP) through

$$-\int\_0^T \int\_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathbb{R}^d} \left[ \left( \partial\_t \phi + v \cdot \nabla\_x \phi - \nabla U\_f \cdot \nabla\_v \phi \right) f \right](t; x, v) \, dxdv \, dt = -\int\_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathbb{R}^d} \phi(0, x) f(0; x, v) \, dxdv$$

for all test functions o E C.º ([0,T) x (X x Re')), since then the product of the solution with the force field is integrable; i.e., ||f(t)▽Uf(t)|| z1(xxma) ∈ L'([0,7]).

While [4, Theorem 1.6] assumed on to be nondecreasing concave in some regime for the 1-Wasserstein stability of (VP), in the p-Wasserstein setting, we instead assume a p-modified version of एक to be nondecreasing concave in some regime as follows:

Assumption 1.6. The growth function G is such that yo . [0, +0) > [0, +0) is nondecreasing concave on [0, cone positive constant co, e.a < 1/e that depends only on p, 0, and d, where yous given by

$$\varphi\_{p,\Theta}(s) := \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } s = 0, \\ s |\log s|^p \Theta^p \left( |\log s| \right) & \text{if } 0 < s \le c\_{p,\Theta;d}, \\ \varphi\_{p,\Theta}(c\_{p,\Theta;d}) & \text{if } s \ge c\_{p,\Theta;d}. \end{cases}$$

This encompasses for instance the bounded case with O(r) = 1 (cg,e;a = e-max(p.d+1}), the exponential Orlicz space with O(r) = r-1/0 and 1 ≤ α < +ο (co,9;α = e-max(p0,4+1), β := 1 + 1/α), and also a countable family of iterated logarithms due to Yudovich [18, Section 3] for two-dimensional Euler's equations in vorticity form; Θη : [0, +∞) (0, +∞) (cp,0;d = min{exp, 22(1), e =d=1}) given by

$$\Theta\_n(r) := \begin{cases} r|\log\_1(r)|^2|\log\_2(r)|^2 \cdots |\log\_n(r)|^2 & \text{if } r \ge \exp\_n(1), \\ \Theta\_n(\exp\_n(1)) & \text{else,} \end{cases}$$

where expo(1) := 1, expm+1(1) := e&xpn(1), and

$$\log\_n(r) := \begin{cases} r & \text{if } n = 0, \\ \underbrace{\log \circ \log \circ \cdots \circ \log}\_{(n-1)\text{times}} \circ |\log r| & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$

Moreover, each of these cases satisfies the following two assumptions:
