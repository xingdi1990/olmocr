the crack tip for 3 = 0. The greater the positive ß is, the higher the reduction is. Similar to Fig. 4, all curves show slightly wavy patterns due to the density-dependent moduli.

Figure 6: 722 vs. r (722 unit: 104 Pa). In the first panel, at r = 0 (the crack-tip), negative 3 does not reduce 722 compared with 722 at 3 = 0. Generally, a more negative value does not necessarily generate greater T22 at the crack tip. In the second panel for ß > 0, positive ß generates smaller T22 value compared with T22 at 3 = 0. Greates smaller T22 at r = 0. Slightly wavy patterns also appear in all the curves due to the effect of the density-dependent moduli.

For the current problem, we do not have an asymptotic or analytical solution. Therefore, an explicit description of crack-tip SIF is not available. However, one can utilize the crack-tip SIF defined for the linear elastic fracture mechanics model and use the finite element solution for the nonlinear model to glean some vital physical insight into SIF.

The SIF Kr in the context of linear elasticity defined as

$$K\_I = \lim\_{r \to 0^+} \sqrt{2\pi r} T\_{22}. \tag{33}$$

It is challenging to analytically compute Kr for complicated models such as the ones in 3-D that we are investigating in this paper. We compute Kr numerically for illustrative purposes to understand its value as a function of the nonlinear modeling parameter 3. The function of 2mm 22 vs. r is shown in Fig. 7. For ß = 0, -10, -20, -30, the Kr values are, respectively, 0.0110, 0.0185, 0.0251, 0.0178; For ß = 0, 10, 20, 30, the Kr values are, respectively, 0.0110, 0.0060, 0.0037, 0.0026 (Unit: 104mm1/2Pa). All the Kr values are very close, implying an identical theoretical Kr value for all ß is highly likely. Such numerical approximation for Kr shows that the nonlinear model with density-dependent moduli is designed appropriately under the common crack criteria used for the linear-elasticity fracture model. Also, in the two panels of Fig. 7, the curve shapes for ß < 0 and ß > 0 are slightly distinct. The ß < 0 curves show a greater curvature, while those for 3 > 0 show flatter behaviors. Such difference is caused by the sign of B, disclosing how negative and positive 3 values impact the SIF differently.
