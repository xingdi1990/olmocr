We point out that there are no conditions on spaces and maps, except normality, making the theorem as broad as possible.

Proof. We keep the same data as in Lemma 34, so liftcat; "(h) = liftcat; } (u). On the other hand, Proposition 12 shows that liftcatjor(u) = liftcat f(h). So we can work with u and f' = j o f rather than with h and f.

By definition, liftcaty (u) ≤ n if and only if there exists a map Φ: Χ -> T"(μ) making the following diagram homotopy commutative:

From Remark 6, we regard the cofibrations w and tm as inclusions and consider that T"(u) = U = (A) ≤ Z = + where p; is the i-th projection p; : Z + -> Zn.

Assume we have the map @ and the homotopy H: X × I → Z%+1 between △n+1 of and tm o Φ.

Consider the open neighborhood N of A in Zh which is deformable in Zh into A with some homotopy G rel A. For 0 < i < n, let hi = p; o t, o & and U2 = h2 +(N). As (tn o @)(X) C T"(u) = Ull o p - 1(A), we have X = Ull \_o Ui

Now we can define homotopies Li : Ui x I -> Zh by:

$$L\_i(u,t) = \begin{cases} p\_i(H(u,2t)) & \text{if } 0 \leqslant t \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \\ G(h\_i(u), 2t - 1) & \text{if } \frac{1}{2} \leqslant t \leqslant 1. \end{cases}$$

Each Li is well defined because pi(H(u, 1)) = p;((tn o D)(u)) = hi(u) = G(h;(u)),0). We have Li(u, 0) = f(u) and Li(u, 1) E A, so Li is a homotopy between f(v; and μο li where li = Li(-, 1).

Conversely assume we have an open cover (Ui)o<isn of X and homotopies Kt: Ui x I -> Zn with Ka(u,0) = f(u) and Ki(u, 1) E A. Choose a closed subset F2 C U2 (possibly the empty set) in each U2. If X is normal, we have two more open covers (Vi)0<i<n and (Wi)0<i<n of X such that

$$F\_i \subset W\_i \subset \overline{W\_i} \subset V\_i \subset \overline{V\_i} \subset U\_i.$$

Moreover, as W; and CV; = X\V; are disjoint closed subspaces of the normal space X, we have an Urysohn map pi: X -> I with Qi(Wi) = 1 and Qi(CV2) = 0.

Now we define Hi: X × I -> Zh by:

$$H\_i(x,t) = \begin{cases} f'(x) & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{G} \overline{V\_i}, \\ K\_i(x, t\varphi\_i(x)) & \text{if } x \in U\_i. \end{cases}$$

Each Hi is well defined because if x E CV2 O Ui, then Ki(x, to2(x)) = Ki(x, 0) = f'(x).

Let H = (Ho, ... , Hn): X x I -> Zx+1 and Φ = H(-, 1). We have H(-, 0) = △n+1 of'. On the other hand, for any x E X, there is (at least) one i such that x E Wi, so ye(x) = 1 and Ha(x, 1) = Ki(x, 1) E A; this means that &(X) ≤ T"(u). Thus H is a homotopy between △n+1 o f' and tn o Φ.
