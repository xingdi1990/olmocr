As the proof will show, the value ro decreases as the value of L increases.

Proof. Let L, r, and po be as in the statement of the lemma. We may assume that po = p\_ is the south pole. Let y be the stereographic projection based at the north pole p+ and let @ be its inverse. Set r1 := arccot(L) and let x denote the biLipschitz constant of the restriction of y to S2 \ B(p+, r1). Finally, set ro := 2-1 · min{r1, L-1, K-2}.

Let 8, : C -> C be the scaling map given by 8,(z) = r-z and denote by n : S2 -> S2 the conformal diffeomorphism agreeing with @ o & o y on S 2 \ {p }. It follows from (2.1) and (2.2) that

$$\eta(B(p\_+,\mathcal{D}r\_1)) = S^{\mathcal{D}} \backslash B(p\_-,h(Lr)) \subset S^{\mathcal{D}} \backslash B(p\_-,Lr)$$

since h(Lr) ≥ Lr.

Now, let p E S2. We distinguish two cases. If B(p, ro) intersects B(p+, r1) nontrivially then B(p, ro) is contained in B(p+, 2r1) and hence, by the above, we have n(B(p, ro)) C S2 \ B(p\_, Lr). If B(p, ro) does not intersect B(p+, r1) then we have

$$\eta(B(p, r\_0)) \subset B(\eta(p), r\kappa^2 r\_0) \subset B(\eta(p), r)$$

since the restriction of y to S2 \ B(p+, r1) is k-biLipschitz.

$$\square$$

Proof of Proposition 9.2. Let 0 < E < ET and let y: S2 -> X be an &-indecomposable map. Define, as in the proof of Proposition 9.1,

$$\delta := \min\left\{\frac{l\_0^2}{2\pi}, \frac{\varepsilon}{10C\_\mathbf{I}}\right\} \quad \text{and} \quad L := 2e^{\delta^{-1}k\mathbf{q}(\epsilon\varphi) + 10^{-1}\varepsilon},$$

where lo > 0 is the scale up to which the isoperimetric inequality holds in X, C is as in (9.1), and kr is as in (3.1). Let 0 < ro < L-1 be as in Lemma 9.3.

Let u E A(g) be as in the statement of the proposition. For each p E S2 set

$$r(p) \coloneqq \inf \left\{ r > 0 \, : \, E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu|\_{B(p,r)}) \ge \mathbf{S}^{-1} \varepsilon\_{\mathbf{I}} \right\}$$

and let 7 > 0 be the infimum of the r(p) over all p ∈ S2. We clearly have

$$E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu|\_{B(p,\mathbb{F})}) \leq \frac{\varepsilon \mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{S}}$$

for every p € S2 and there exists p € S2 such that equality holds for p = ñ. If 7 ≥ ro then the proposition holds with 7 being the identity mapping, so we may assume that 7 < ro. We claim that

$$(9.2)\tag{9.2} = \qquad \qquad E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\boldsymbol{\mu}|\_{B(\vec{\boldsymbol{\mu}},L\vec{\boldsymbol{\nu}})}) > E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\boldsymbol{\mu}) - \frac{\mathfrak{E}}{\mathfrak{S}}.$$

The proposition easily follows from this together with Lemma 9.3. Indeed, let n: S2 -> S2 be as in the lemma applied with po = p and r = r. Then for every p € S2 we have

$$\eta(B(p, r\_0)) \subset B(\eta(p), \bar{r}) \quad \text{or} \quad \eta(B(p, r\_0)) \cap B(\bar{p}, L\bar{r}) = \emptyset.$$

In the first case we obtain

$$E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu \circ \eta|\_{B(p,r\_0)}) \le E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu|\_{B(\eta(p),\overline{r})}) \le \frac{\varepsilon\_{\overline{\mathbf{I}}}}{\overline{\mathbf{S}}}.$$

and in the second case

$$E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu \circ \eta |\_{B(p,r\_0)}) \le E\_{\mathbf{I}}(\mu |\_{S^2 \backslash B(\bar{\rho}, L\bar{\rho})}) \le \frac{\kappa\_{\mathbf{I}}}{\mathbf{S}}.$$

This establishes the proposition assuming (9.2).
