## Abstract

An explicit first-order drift-randomized Milstein scheme for a regime switching stochastic differential equation is proposed and its bi-stability and rate of strong convergence are investigated for a non-differentiable drift coefficient. Precisely, drift is Lipschitz continuous while diffusion along with its derivative is Lipschitz continuous. Further, we explore the significance of evaluating Brownian trajectories at every switching time of the underlying Markov chain in achieving the convergence rate 1.0 of the proposed scheme. In this context, possible variants of the scheme, namely modified randomized and reduced randomized schemes, are considered and their convergence rates are shown to be 1/2. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence rates of these schemes along with their corresponding non-randomized versions. Further, it is illustrated that the half-order non-randomized reduced and modified schemes outperforms the classical Euler scheme.

## 1. Introduction

Let (Ω, 9, P) be a complete probability space. Consider a d-dimensional standard Brownian motion B := {B(t)}{>0 with natural filtration RP := { & P };>0. Further, assume that r := {r(t)}+>0 is a Markov chain with finite state space S := {1, . . , m'} and generator Q := (qjoko)jo.ko where qjoko ≥ 0 for jo ≠ % and qjojo = - > 910ko which implies that the transition probability matrix of r is given by, ko≠jo

$$\tilde{\mathbb{P}}(r(t+\Delta) = k\_0 | r(t) = j\_0) = \begin{cases} \mathfrak{q}\_{j\_0 k\_0} \Delta + \mathrm{o}(\Delta), & k\_0 \neq j\_0, \\ 1 + \mathfrak{q}\_{j\_0 j\_0} \Delta + \mathrm{o}(\Delta), & k\_0 = j\_0, \end{cases}$$

for any t ≥ 0, jo, kg E S and △ > 0. The natural filtration of r is denoted by M := { } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } } consider an Po-measurable Xo and assume that r, B and Xo are independent. Define F == { & } } > where & := & P V & for t ≥ 0. For a fixed T > 0, let b : [0, 7] × Rd × S → Re and o : [0, T] x Rd x S => Rdxd be Borel measurable functions.

Consider the following d-dimensional regime switching stochastic differential equation, also referred to as stochastic differential equation with Markovian switching (SDEwMS),

$$X(t) = X\_0 + \int\_0^t b(s, X(s), r(s))ds + \sum\_{\ell=1}^{\bar{d}} \int\_0^t \sigma\_\ell(s, X(s), r(s))dB\_\ell(s) \tag{1}$$
