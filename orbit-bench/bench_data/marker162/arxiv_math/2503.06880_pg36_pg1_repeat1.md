Obviously W contains an open neighborhood of zero. Now let z = (r(f1), m(f2), ··· , r(fn)). By assumption and the fact that W is compact, z & W. Since W compact we can find a bounded linear functional that strictly separates W and zo. Namely we can find (1), 22, … , An) E C" such that:

$$\sum\_{i \leqslant n} \lambda\_i r(f\_i) > 1 \qquad\quad\text{and}\qquad\quad\forall \,(x\_1, \dots, x\_n) \in \overline{W}, \quad\sum\_{i \leqslant n} \lambda\_i x\_i \leqslant 1$$

Therefore | Zi≤n \ifi ≤ 1 and hence:

$$1 < r \left( \sum\_{i \le n} \lambda\_i f\_i \right) \ll \|r\| \left\| \sum\_{i \le n} \lambda\_i f\_i \right\| \ll 1$$

which is absurd. Hence for any {fi}i≤n ≤ X\* and o ∈ (0,1):

$$\left( \left( r(f\_1), \dots, r(f\_n) \right) \in \overline{\{ (f\_1(x), \dots, f\_n(x)) \mid x \in X\_{\leqslant 1} \}} \subseteq (1 + \sigma) \{ (f\_1(x), \dots, f\_n(x)) \mid x \in X\_{\leqslant 1} \} \right)$$

Or

$$(r(f\_1), \dots, r(f\_n)) \in \{ (f\_1(x), \dots, f\_n(x)) \mid x \in X\_{\le 1+\sigma} \}$$

Proposition 5.3. Any non-reflexive Banach space X will have a bounded bi-orthogonal system (et, fj).jew such that supn | Zi≤n ei| < ∞ or supn | Σi≤n fi| < ∞

Proof. Let r = X \*\* \ ( X ) and suppose H is an arbitrary finite dimensional subspace of X . Define:

$$\rho = \sup \left\{ \left| r(y) \right| : y \in X\_{=1}^\* \cap H^\perp \right\}.$$

Suppose H = Span{h1,h2, ··· , lm} and H\* = Span{f1, f2; ··· , fn} where f((h;) = 1 iff i = j. If p = 0, then r = (H+)+. Observe that Q(H)- = Q(H-) and (H-)- = Q(H-)1. Then r e [Q(H)+] = Q(H) = Q(X), which is absurd. Hence p > 0. Below we will start constructing the desired bi-orthogonal system.

Suppose || | = 1. Fix o e (0, 1). y1 € X2 so that B1 = r(y1) > = By Proposition 5.2 we can find b = X (1+ so that y1(b1) = B1. Define E1 = Span{b1} and:

$$\rho\_1 = \sup \left\{ r(y) \mid y \in X\_{=1}^\* \cap E\_1^\perp \right\}.$$

By the previous remark, we have p1 > 0. Next find y2 € X \* ^ E = so that ß2 = r(92) > = 01. Again by Proposition 5.2, find b2 E X <1+0 so that y1(02) = 01, y2(b2) = 02. Define E2 = Span{01, b2} and:

$$\rho\_2 = \sup \left\{ r(y) \mid y \in X\_{=1}^\* \cap E\_2^\perp \right\}$$

and similarly P2 > 0. By induction for each n E N we will have {0;ix(0 = X(1+0; En = Span(0;i)(≤n) yi+1 € X\*1 △ E+ , {Bi}i<n and:

$$\rho\_n = \sup\left\{ r(y) \mid y \in X\_{=1}^\* \cap E\_n^\perp \right\}$$

$$\text{such that } \beta\_1 = r(y\_1) > \frac{1}{2}, \beta\_{n+1} = r(y\_{n+1}) \in \left(\frac{1}{2}\rho\_n, \rho\_n\right) \text{ and for each } i, j \in \{1, 2, \cdots, n\};$$

$$y\_i(b\_j) = \begin{cases} r(y\_i), & 1 \le i \le j \le n \\ 0, & 1 \le j < i \le n \end{cases}$$

Since H+ is decreasing as n increases, we have {{n} is non-increasing sequence in (0, 1] and hence convergent. Assume that infm Pr = lim, Pn = 0. For each E = (0,1) and then suppose Pn < € for all n > N. Fix f = X = and for each n E N, define 7n (f) = maxi≤n |f(bi) | and:

$$z\_n(f) = \frac{1}{\beta\_1} f(b\_1) y\_1 + \sum\_{1 \le i \le n} \frac{1}{\beta\_i} [f(b\_i) - f(b\_{i-1})] y\_i$$

Since for each n E N:

$$0 < \frac{1}{2}\rho\_{n+1} < \beta\_n \leqslant \rho\_n$$
