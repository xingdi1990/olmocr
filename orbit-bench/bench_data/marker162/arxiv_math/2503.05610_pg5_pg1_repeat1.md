## 3.1 Zero Infimum Spacing

The next theorem gives a condition under which the infimum spacing is zero. Here our main result is Theorem 2, where we show that the existence of a nonzero repulsive fixed point of the spectral decimation with multiplier, larger than the zero fixed point indicates zero infimum spacing in the spectrum.

Theorem 2. Assume △ admits spectral decimation with spectral decimation function R and suppose 0, § > 0 are fixed point of R with |R'(()| > R'(0)| > 1. Then inf{|) -> > | : > + > , x = o(△)} = 0.

Proof. Let oc be the inverse branch of R with & in it's range. Note that & is in the Julia set of R and is an attracting fixed point of ¢c and hence we may choose n, and x1,x2 € o(△n) so that ¢("(x;) → ς, j = 1,2 [HSTZ11]. Therefore, we have,

$$\begin{aligned} \left| \phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(x\_{1}) - \phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(x\_{2}) \right| &= \left| (\phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(\gamma\_{m}))' \right| |x\_{1} - x\_{2}| \\ &= \left| \phi\_{\zeta}'(\phi\_{\zeta}^{m-1}(\gamma\_{m})) \right| \dots \left| \phi\_{\zeta}'(\gamma\_{m}) \right| |x\_{1} - x\_{2}| \end{aligned}$$

Note that pc is a continuous injective map and hence monotone. Therefore, it is no loss to assume, \$(x1) ≤ \$(1m) ≤ \$(1m) ≤ \$(x2), Vk. Thus, φ2(7m) - < < max;j={1,2} Φ2(x;) - ς Hence, by continuity of R', given 8 > 0 there is N so that m ≥ k ≥ N => |R'(()| - δ ≤ R'(φ"(1m) . Thus, [R'(4) = (R'(c)=8); Vk ≥ N. So for m > N, we have, 1 1

$$\begin{split} \left| \phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(x\_{1}) - \phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(x\_{2}) \right| &\leq \frac{1}{\left| R'(\phi\_{\zeta}^{m}(\gamma\_{m})) \right|} \cdot \dots \cdot \left| \overline{R'(\phi\_{\zeta}(\gamma\_{m}))} \right| \left| x\_{1} - x\_{2} \right| \\ &\leq \frac{1}{\left( R'(\zeta) - \delta \right)^{m-N}} \frac{1}{R'(\phi\_{\zeta}^{N}(\gamma\_{m}))} \cdot \dots \frac{1}{R'(\phi\_{\zeta}(\gamma\_{m}))} \left| x\_{1} - x\_{2} \right|. \end{split}$$

Now note that

$$\left| c\_{\Delta}^{n+j+m} \phi\_0^j \phi\_{\zeta}^m(x\_1) - c\_{\Delta}^{n+j+m} \phi\_0^j \phi\_{\zeta}^m(x\_2) \right| = c\_{\Delta}^n \cdot c\_{\Delta}^j \left| (\phi\_0^j)'(\gamma\_j) \right| \cdot c\_{\Delta}^m \left| \phi\_{\zeta}^m(x\_1) - \phi\_{\zeta}^m(x\_2) \right| $$

for some y; lying between ¢(x1) and ¢2 (x2). Choose & so that R(0) < |R'(()| - S and observe that cil (x1) - \$2"(x2) -> 0 as m -> ∞.

Hence by [Shi96, Proposition 3.1], it remains to show that co (0)/(1/j/ converges to a finite number as j → ∞.
