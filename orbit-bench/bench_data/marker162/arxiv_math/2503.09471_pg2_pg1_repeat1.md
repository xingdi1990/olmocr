1) S2(t,t) = id, S2(t,to) = S2(t, s)S2(s,to) for all t, s, to E [T, ∞); 2) and for almost all t,s E [7, ∞) it holds that

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Omega(t, s) &= A(t) \Omega(t, s), \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \Omega(t, s) &= -A(s) \Omega(t, s). \end{aligned} \tag{3}$$

A non-empty, closed, convex subset K C H is called a cone, if R+K C K and K()(-K) = {0} hold. A cone K is called generating if any x E H can be written as x = x+ - xfor some x E K. In a Hilbert space any generating cone is nonflat, that is there exists a constant ak > 0, independent on x, such that in the representation x = x+ - x - the vectors x= can be chosen so that

$$\|\boldsymbol{x}^{\pm}\| \le a\_K \|\boldsymbol{x}\|.\tag{4}$$

The set K\* = {f ∈ L(H;R) : f(K) C R+} C H \* = H is called adjoint cone. If K is generating, then K\* is normal, i.e., there is a constant by > 0 such that x E K, y -x E K imply ||x|| ≤ bx||y||. A cone K is called selfadjoint if K\* = K. In a Hilbert space any selfadjoint cone is normal [13].

Definition 1: Let K be a generating and selfadjoint cone in H. System (1) is called Wazewski [14] with respect to K (also called monotone [15]) if its evolution operator Ω2 satisfies Ω(t,s)K C K for all t > s > T.

Definition 2: We say that (1) is stable in K if for any E > 0 and any to ≥ t there is a 8 = 8(E,to) > 0 such that x0 E Bs ( x(t;to,xo)| < &, t ≥ to; if, in addition, the & can be chosen independent on to, then (1) is called uniformly stable in K:

asymptotically stable in K if it is stable in K and there is n = n(to) > 0 such that xo E Bn NK => lim2->0 |x(t;to,x0)| = 0; if, in addition, n can be chosen independent on to, then (1) is called uniformly asymptotically stable in K.

If any of the above properties holds with . H on the place of K, then we drop "in K" in their definitions.

Let system (1) be decomposed in two subsystems as follows

$$\dot{\mathbf{x}}\_{i} = A\_{il}(t)\mathbf{x}\_{l} + A\_{lj}(t)\mathbf{x}\_{j}, \quad i \neq j, \quad i, j = 1, 2, \qquad (5)$$

with xi E Hi, Aij E L(Hi,Hi) for i, j = 1,2. Let Ki be a solid selfadjoint cone in Hi, then K = K1 ( K2 is a solid and selfadjoint cone in H .

Let 2; E C([7,00) x [7,00);L(H;)) denote the evolution operator of the decoupled subsystem

$$\mathbf{y}\_{i} = A\_{il}(t)\mathbf{y}\_{i}, \quad \mathbf{y}\_{i} \in \mathcal{H}\_{l}^{\ell}, \quad i = 1, 2 \tag{6}$$

It can be verified by definition that (1), written as (5), is a Wazewski system for the cone K, if and only if

$$\mathbf{Q}\_i(t, s)\mathbf{K}\_i \subset \mathbf{K}\_i \qquad \text{and} \qquad A\_{ij}(t)\mathbf{K}\_j \subset \mathbf{K}\_i, \quad t \ge s \ge \pi. \tag{7}$$

Definition 3: An operator OEL(H;,Hi) is called positive, if it satisfies OK; C K; and it is denoted by 0 ≥ 0. For the evolution operator S2i of (6) let ai, Bi, Yi, di E C(T,∞);R>0) be such that

$$\begin{aligned} \left||\mathfrak{Q}\_{i}(t,s)\right|| &\leq \alpha\_{i}(t)\beta\_{i}(s), \quad t \geq s \geq \mathfrak{r},\\ \left||\mathfrak{Q}\_{i}(t,s)\right|| &\leq \left(\mathfrak{N}(t)\right)^{-1} \left(\mathfrak{S}\_{i}(s)\right)^{-1}, \quad s \geq t \geq \mathfrak{r}, \end{aligned} \tag{8}$$

for example we can fix any p ∈ (s,t) and take ai(t) = ||22;(t,p)|, ßi(s) = ||2;(p,s)|| due to ≤2;(t,s) = S2i(t,p)S2i(p,s).

Let qi E C((T, ∞); B>0) be suitable weight functions guaranteeing convergence of the next integrals for t E [T, o)

$$\begin{aligned} \phi\_l(t) &:= \eta\_l^2(t) \int\_l q\_l(s) \boldsymbol{\delta}\_l^2(s) \, ds, \\ g\_l(t) &:= \mathcal{B}\_l^2(t) \int\_l q\_l(s) \boldsymbol{\alpha}\_l^2(s) \, ds. \end{aligned} \tag{9}$$

## III. MAIN RESULTS

For simplicity and clearness in this work we consider the case of r = 2 interconnected subsystems in (5). An extension for r E N will developed elsewhere. We introduce the following notation for 1 < i + j ≤ 2: linear weighted integral gains for the interconnection (5) are defined as

$$\begin{split} \mathfrak{a}\_{il}(t\_0) &= 2 \sup\_{t \ge t\_0} \mathfrak{a}\_l(t) \mathcal{B}\_i^2(t) \\ \times \int\_I \mathfrak{a}\_i(s) ||A\_{jl}(s)|| \mathcal{B}\_j(s) \int\_s^\infty \frac{\mathfrak{a}\_l(p)\mathfrak{a}\_j(p) ||A\_{ij}(p)||}{\mathfrak{a}\_l(p)} dp \, ds, \\\\ \pi\_{il}(t\_0) &= 2 \sup \mathfrak{a}\_l(t) \mathcal{B}\_i^2(t) \end{split} (10)$$

$$\begin{aligned} \mathfrak{m}\_{j1(\,^0\Omega)} &= \underset{\begin{subarray}{c} \mathbf{1} \geq \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{1} \geq \mathbf{0} \end{subarray}}{\operatorname\*{arg\,max}} \|\mathbf{1}\_{j\mathbf{1}}(s)\| \, \underset{\mathbf{1} \geq \mathbf{0}}{\operatorname\*{arg\,max}} \int\_{\mathbf{s}}^{\infty} \underbrace{\mathcal{\alpha}\_{i}(p)\mathcal{\alpha}\_{j}(p) \|A\_{j\mathbf{i}}(p)\|}\_{\mathbf{0}(\,^t\mathbf{1})} \, dp \, ds, \end{aligned} (11)$$

where w; are suitable weight functions, which can help to enable convergence of the integrals. Also for f & C(to,T];L(H;)) we introduce the weighted norm

$$||f||\_{\mathcal{O}\_l,T} := \max\_{t \in [t\_0,T]} \mathcal{O}\_l(t) ||f(t)||. \tag{12}$$

Theorem 1: Let (1) be a Wazewski system with respect to a selfadjoint solid cone K and written as (5) with r = 2. Let di, Bi, Yi, oi be as in (8) and di, gi, qi, di, Tij as in (9),(10),(11). If the spectral radius of the matrix II(to) E R2×2 defined by the weighted integral gains Tij(to) satisfies

$$r\_{\sigma}(\Pi(t\_0)) < 1\tag{13}$$

then solutions to (1) satisfy the estimate

$$||\mathbf{x}(t; t\_0, \mathbf{x}\_0)|| \le 2a\_K \sqrt{\frac{h(t\_0, t\_0)}{\Phi(t)}} \exp\left(-\int\_{t\_0}^t \frac{q(s)}{2h(s, t\_0)} ds\right) ||\mathbf{x}\_0||,$$

$$\dots, \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad \dots \quad (14)$$

where ak is from (4), q(t) := min{q1(t),q2(t)}, Φ(t) := min{φ1(t),Φ2(t)} and h(t,to) := max{h1](t,to) +
