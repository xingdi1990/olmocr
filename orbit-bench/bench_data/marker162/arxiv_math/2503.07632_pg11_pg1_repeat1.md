$$w\_c(f, N, A, t) = \sum\_{n=1}^{N} a\_n \, w(nf, t),$$

The next lemma shows that the denominators present in the cosine similarity formula play little role in our considerations under appropriate assumptions on f and N.

Lemma 2. Let an E [0,1] for n = 1, ... , N. We have

$$\left| \int\_{0}^{T} w\_{c}(f, N, A, t)^{2} \, dt - \frac{NT}{2} \right| \le \frac{N^{2}}{2\pi f}$$

Proof. We are looking for a bound on the integral of w2, that is the following expression

$$\sum\_{n=1}^{N} \sum\_{m=1}^{N} \int\_{0}^{T} a\_n a\_m w(nf, t) w(mf, t) \, dt$$

We obtain the desired bound by looking at the diagonal (i.e. those, where n = m) and the non-diagonal entries in the summation, and applying the first and second part of the earlier lemma. For the diagonal entries, we have

$$\frac{NT}{2} - \frac{N}{8\pi f} \le \sum\_{n=1}^{N} \int\_0^T a\_n^2 w^2(nf, t) \, dt \le \frac{NT}{2} + \frac{N}{8\pi f}$$
