Figure 12: The cycle C created by two distinct paths from v' to x'

to it in C. Let v; ; ; be one such chord; then we show that y lies in P(v1, x; ) in the next claim.

## Claim 6.6. y lies in P(v, x').

Proof. If y does not lie in P(v), x), then y must lie in the path between vi, and x (or the path between v; and v; ). If it lies on the path between v; and x; (resp. between v; and v'), then we have a path from v;, to x' (resp. between v; and v') which has length smaller than d(vi, x) (resp. d(vi, v')), which is a contradiction. Hence, y lies in P(v, x; ) (refer to Figure 12b).

Note that d(x', y) ≥ d(x', v;) and d(v', y) ≥ d(v', v; }. If not, then there exists a shorter or equal length path from v to v; (from x to v;) that bypasses the edge v; v (resp. vi.x), which is a contradiction to the fact that the pair vi, v (resp. vi, x) monitors the edge vi (resp. vi,x). Hence dp(x1, v1) = d(x1, y) + d(y, vi) > d(v1, vi) + d(x1, vi), implying dp(x', vi) = d(v', vi) + d(x', vi;). This implies that d(x', y) = d(x', v; ) and d(v', y) = d(v', v; ), which implies that the vertex y is unique in P(v, x'). This fact together with Claim 6.6 implies that in C, v; is incident to exactly one chord.

Now note that if v and y are not adjacent, then the induced 2-path you, v is part of a chordless cycle of length at least 4, which is a contradiction. Hence vy E E(Gr+1). Similarly, it can be shown that xy E E(Gk+1). Hence vv; x is part of a 4-cycle vv; xyv, which leads to a contradiction. Hence v' and x' monitor vvi.

Hence, until now, we showed that all edges in Ei can be monitored by the vertices of Man(Gx) { {v; }. Hence, combining this fact with Claim 6.1 and 6.3, we can conclude that Man(Gk+1) forms an optimal MEG set of Gk+1. Hence, meg(G) = |Man(G) for every strongly chordal graph G. 

## 7. Conclusion and future aspects

In this paper, we solved the complexity status of the MIN-MEG problem for some well-known graph classes. Next, it will be interesting to address the following questions:
