Lorentz spaces LP'9(R, u) are an important generalization of Lebesgue spaces, where either p ∈ (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞] or p = q = 1 or p = q = ∞. The corresponding r.i. function norm | · LP,9(R,u) is defined as

$$\|f\|\_{L^{p,q}(R,\mu)} = \|t^{\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q}}f^\*(t)\|\_{L^q(0,\infty)},\ f \in \mathcal{A}^+(R,\mu).$$

However, one needs to be more careful here. The functional || · ||Le.2(R.u) is not an r.i. function norm when 1 < p < q ≤ ∞, because it is not subadditive. When 1 < p < q ≤ x, the functional | · | Lng(R,u) is merely equivalent to an r.i. function norm. More precisely, the functional

$$\|f\|\_{L^{(p,q)}(R,\mu)} = \|f^{\ast\ast}\|\_{L^{p,q}(0,\infty)}, \; f \in \mathcal{A}^+(R,\mu),$$

is an r.i. function norm, and there are positive constants C1 and C2 such that

$$C\_1 \|f\|\_{L^{\langle p,q\rangle}(R,\mu)} \le \|f\|\_{L^{p,q}(R,\mu)} \le C\_2 \|f\|\_{L^{\langle p,q\rangle}(R,\mu)} \quad \text{for every } f \in \mathcal{A}^+(R,\mu),$$

provided that either p E (1, ∞) and q ∈ [1, ∞ | or p = q = ∞. The interested reader can find more information in [6, Chapter 4, Section 4] or [33]. In view of that, we will consider LP19(R, u) an r.i. space even when 1 < p < q ≤ o. Note that

$$\|\cdot\|\_{L^p(R,\mu)} = \|\cdot\|\_{L^{p,p}(R,\mu)} \quad \text{for every } p \in [1,\infty].$$

Furthermore, when p E (1, 0) and 1 ≤ q1 < q2 ≤ 00, we have

$$L^{p,q\_1}(R,\mu) \subsetneq L^{p,q\_2}(R,\mu),$$

regardless of whether µ(R) < ∞ or not. Orlicz spaces LA(R, u) are another very important generalization of Lebesgue spaces. The corresponding r.i. function norm || · | LA(R,u) is defined as

$$\|f\|\|\_{L^{4}(R,\mu)} = \inf \left\{ \lambda > 0 : \int\_{R} A\left(\frac{|f(x)|}{\lambda}\right) \mathrm{d}\mu(x) \le 1 \right\}, \ f \in \mathcal{A}^{+}(R,\mu),$$

where A: [0,00] -> [0,00] is a Young function. A function A: [0,00] is called a Young function if it is convex, left-continuous, vanishing at 0, and not constant on the entire interval (0, ∞). For example, when p ∈ [1, ∞), we have || |LP(R,u) = || ||LA(R,u) with A(t) = tP, t ≥ 0. We also have || || Lo(R,u) = || ||LA(R,u) with A(t) = ∞ . x(1,∞(t), t ≥ 0. Besides the classical textbooks [6, 53], the interested reader can find more information on the contemporary theory of Orlicz spaces and in particular Orlicz-Sobolev spaces in [16, 46].

An analogue of Fatou's lemma is at our disposal in the framework of r.i. spaces. More precisely, if M (R, μ) = fk -> f pointwise u-a.e., then

$$(2.1) \qquad \qquad \|f\|\_{X(R,\mu)} \le \liminf\_{k \to \infty} \|f\_k\|\_{X(R,\mu)}.$$

With any r.i. function norm || · | x(R.u), there is associated another r.i. function norm, || · | x ( R,u), defined for g ∈ M + ( R, μ ) as

$$\langle 2.2 \rangle \qquad \|g\|\_{X'(R,\mu)} = \sup\_{\|f\|\_{X(R,\mu)} \le 1} \int\_R |f(x)| |g(x)| \, \mathrm{d}\mu(x), \ g \in \mathcal{A}^+(R,\mu).$$

The r.i. function norm | · | x (R,u) is called the associate norm of | · ||x(R,u). The resulting r.i. space X'(R, u) is called the associate space. The definition of || x(R,u) immediately gives us that the Hölder inequality

$$\text{(2.3)}\qquad \int\_{R} |f| |g| \, \text{d}\mu \le \|f\|\_{X(R,\mu)} \|g\|\_{X'(R,\mu)} \quad \text{for all } f, g \in \mathcal{A}'(R,\mu).$$
