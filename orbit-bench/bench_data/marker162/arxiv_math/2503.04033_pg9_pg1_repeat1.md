$$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{f} \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A}\_{11} & \mathbf{A}\_{15} \\ & \mathbf{A}\_{22} & \mathbf{A}\_{25} \\ \mathbf{A}\_{51} & \mathbf{A}\_{52} & \mathbf{A}\_{55} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{u}\_{1} \\ \mathbf{u}\_{2} \\ \mathbf{u}\_{5} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{f}\_{1} \\ \mathbf{f}\_{2} \\ \mathbf{f}\_{5} \end{bmatrix}. \tag{8}$$

Here u is the solution and f is the body load on the interior of S2, split into the two subdomains and shared boundary. Because an elliptic PDO is a local operator there is no interaction through A on f1 by u2 or f2 by u1, so A = 0 in those submatrices. However, both u1 and u2, are local to the shared boundary where us lies, so they both interact with the body load there, f5, through A. To interpret the first two block rows, note that

$$\mathbf{A}\_{11}\mathbf{u}\_1 + \mathbf{A}\_{15}\mathbf{u}\_5 = \mathbf{f}\_1 \iff \mathbf{u}\_1 = -\mathbf{A}\_{11}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\_{15}\mathbf{u}\_5 + \mathbf{A}\_{11}^{-1}\mathbf{f}\_1 \tag{9}$$

This is similar to our solution operator formulation shown in (4), with the part of the subdomain boundary on 00 now folded into u1. Next, let u1 = A = f1 and u2 = A22 f2. If we supply these vectors in place of u1, u2 in (8) and set us = 0, then the equation still holds with the same body loads f and f2. Thus u1 and u2 are the particular solutions to our PDE on the interiors of (2(2), and (2) with us = 0. Now consider an upper triangular matrix U that satisfies

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{A}\_{11}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\_{15} \\
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{A}\_{22}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\_{25} \\
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{u}\_{1} \\
\mathbf{u}\_{2} \\
\mathbf{u}\_{5}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\_{1} \\
\tilde{\mathbf{u}}\_{2} \\
\mathbf{u}\_{5}
\end{bmatrix}.
\tag{10}
$$

This linear system can be confirmed with (9). U decouples our solutions u1, u2 into the particular solutions u1, u2 which are derived from our global Dirichlet BC without the subdomain-only (shared face) Dirichlet BC, and u5 which is that subdomain-only boundary condition. Thus U-1 collects both components of our solutions - in effect it represents the end of solving the merged system, where we use u3 and u5 to get u1, and u4 and u5 to get u2. Next, let L be a lower triangular matrix defined such that

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I} & \\
& \mathbf{I} \\
\mathbf{A}\_{51}\mathbf{A}\_{11}^{-1} & \mathbf{A}\_{52}\mathbf{A}\_{22}^{-1} & \mathbf{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}\_{1} \\
\mathbf{f}\_{2} \\
\mathbf{f}\_{5} - \mathbf{A}\_{51}\mathbf{A}\_{11}^{-1}\mathbf{f}\_{1} - \mathbf{A}\_{52}\mathbf{A}\_{22}^{-1}\mathbf{f}\_{2} \\
\mathbf{f}\_{5}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{f}\_{1} \\
\mathbf{f}\_{2} \\
\mathbf{f}\_{5}
\end{bmatrix}.
\tag{11}
$$
