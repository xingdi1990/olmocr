On contrary, assume that 0 € Conv { (x ) } } } } } } } } } } } } } and {0} are closed and convex sets
it then with the help of theorem of separation, there exists v E Re and b E R such that v" 0 ≥ b and v d < b Vd € Conv ( ) dHz(x\*)}. Jointly both inequality contradicts (3.1). Hence, 0 € Conv ( ) dH;(x\*). Conversely, it needs to be proven that if 0 € Conv | | dH;(x\*) , then x\* is a Pareto critical point for H. For this purpose, define H(x) = max Hj(x) = Hj(x) . Then, by item (ii) of Theorem 2.2, ðÄ(x) = Conv ( ) ðHjx) >. Hence, the assumption leads to 0 € Conv ( critical point, then according to Definition 2.3, there exists s E D such that Vh;(x\*)) s < 0, for all i € I(x\*), j e A, i.e., H'(x", s) < 0 for all j. Then there exists some η > 0 sufficiently small such that H (x" + ης) < H ;(x") for all j which implies H(x\* + ns) < 0 = H(x\*) holds for some (x\* + ns) E D. This contradicts the fact that x\* = arg min H(x). As a consequence, the assumption that x\* is not a Pareto critical point is incorrect, and x\* is indeed a Pareto critical point for H. L

Theorem 3.1. If h;(x, ;) is continuously differentiable and convex for each j = A and & = D is a weak efficient solution solution for OWC purs if and only if

$$0 \in conv\left(\cup\_{i=1}^{n} \partial H\_{j}(x^\*)\right)$$

Proof. Let x\* be a weak efficient solution for OWC P(U). It must be shown that 0 € Conv JendH (x"). Since given function h;(x, {;) is continuously differentiable and convex for each j and ≤; ≤;) will be locally Lipschitz continuous for all i ∈ Ã. Then 0 ∈ Conv{UjeA0H ¡(x")} (see Theorem 4.3 in [71] ).

Conversely, by assumption 0 € Conv(UjeAdH (x\*)) it is clear that x\* is Pareto critical point. Then for atleast one j' it is established that H',(x", d) ≥ 0, V d E D - {x"}. Now, by using the Definition 2.2, it follows that

$$\nabla h\_{\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\boldsymbol{0}}}(\mathbf{x}^{\*},\xi\_{i})^{\boldsymbol{I}}\,\boldsymbol{d}\geq 0,\ \forall\,\,\boldsymbol{d}\in\mathcal{D},\,\,\boldsymbol{i}\in I\_{\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\boldsymbol{0}}}(\mathbf{x}^{\*}).\tag{3.2}$$

By convexity of H; and h;(x, §;), it is obtained that

$$h\_{\boldsymbol{\varrho}}(\mathbf{x}, \boldsymbol{\xi}\_{i}) \ge h\_{\boldsymbol{\varrho}}(\mathbf{x}^{\*}, \boldsymbol{\xi}\_{i}) + \nabla h\_{\boldsymbol{\varrho}}(\mathbf{x}^{\*}, \boldsymbol{\xi}\_{i})^{T} (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^{\*}), \text{ } \forall \ i \in I\_{\boldsymbol{\varrho}}(\mathbf{x}^{\*}) \text{ and } \mathbf{x}, \ \mathbf{x}^{\*} \in D.$$

Since the last term of the latest inequality is positive by (3.2), it is established that

$$h\_{\varrho}(\mathbf{x}, \xi\_i) \ge h\_{\varrho}(\mathbf{x}^\*, \xi\_i), \ \forall \ i \in I\_{\varrho}(\mathbf{x}^\*),$$

and therefore

$$H\_{\!\!\!\!T}(\mathbf{x}) \ge H\_{\!\!\!\!T}(\mathbf{x}^\*), \ \forall \mathbf{x} \in D, \ \mathbf{x}$$

i.e., x\* is weak efficient solution.
