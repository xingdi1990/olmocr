Lemma 3.1. Assume that T E The and S E Sp satisfy 0 + T N C S. Then we have

$$\|\|\nabla^m(v\_h - \mathring{I}\_h v\_h)\|\|\_{L^p(T)} \le C h\_T^{1/p - m} \|v\_h\|\|\_{L^p(S)} \quad \forall v\_h \in V\_h,$$

where m = 0, 1, ... and 1 ≤ p < 00.

We recall from [3, Theorem 5] standard interpolation error estimates for In :

Lemma 3.2. Let l, m E N satisfy 0 ≤ l ≤ m ≤ k + 1 and p ∈ [1, co]. Assume the embedding W™ => C holds for subsets in RN. Then we have

$$\|v - I\_h v\|\_{W^{1,p}(T)} \le C h^{m-l} \|v\|\_{W^{m,p}(T)} \quad (T \in \mathcal{T}\_h, \ v \in W^{m,p}(T)).$$

Estimates for Ip are, however, more involved because of domain perturbation (u = 0 on I does not necessarily imply w = 0 on In . We state it in the following form, whose proof is similar to that of Proposition 5.1 below (we only have to consider global Ω+ and set v2 = 0 there) and thus omitted here.

Proposition 3.1. Under the assumptions of Lemma 3.2, let m ≥ 2 and v E W™™(Ω) satisfy v = 0 on F. Then we have

$$\left(\sum\_{T\in\mathcal{T}\_h} \|\nabla^l(v - \mathring{I}\_h v)\|\_{L^p(T)}^p\right)^{1/p} \le Ch^{m-l} \|v\|\_{W^{m,p}(\Omega\_h)} + Ch^{k+1-l} \|\nabla^2 v\|\_{L^p(\Gamma(\delta))},$$

with the obvious modification for p = ∞.

4. REDUCTION TO W1-1-ANALYSIS OF A REGULARIZED GREEN FUNCTION

Fixing arbitrary K ∈ Th and z ∈ K, we try to bound the pointwise error ü(z)—ur(z). We construct a regularized delta function; the proof is given in the appendix.

Proposition 4.1. For K E Th and z E K, there exists n = ηκ = ∈ C (K) such that dist(suppη, 0K) ≥ Chx, ||▽™η|| L∞(K) ≤ ChzN-m (m = 0,1), and

$$
\psi(v\_h, \eta)\_K = v\_h(\mathbf{z}) \quad \text{for } v\_h = \hat{v}\_h \circ \mathbf{F}\_K^{-1} \text{ with } \operatorname{arbitrary} \; \hat{v}\_h \in \mathbb{P}\_k(\bar{T}),
$$

where the constant C is independent of K, z, and hx.

Next we introduce a "dyadic decomposition" of 02n. We set a sequence of scales:

$$d\_0 = Lh, \quad d\_j = 2^j d\_0 \quad \text{for} \quad j = 1, \dots, J := \left\lceil \frac{\log(\text{diam}\,\Omega\_h/d\_0)}{\log 2} \right\rceil$$

where L means the ratio of the "initial stride" do to the "minimum scale" h. As we see later, L will be taken sufficiently large (but independently of h). Then we define a subset Sh.j of Ωη-which has the scale d; in terms of the distance from K-by

$$\begin{aligned} \Omega\_{h0} &= \bigcup \{ T \in \mathcal{T}\_h \mid d(T, K) \le d\_0 \}, \\ \Omega\_{h,j} &= \bigcup \{ T \in \mathcal{T}\_h \mid d\_{j-1} < d(T, K) \le d\_j \} \ (j = 1, \dots, J), \end{aligned}$$

where d(T,T') = min{{x = x'| | x ∈ T,x' e T'} denotes a distance function between two elements T, T ∈ 7, They are compatible with a standard ball B(z;r) = {x | |x = z| ≤ r} and annulus A(z; r, R) = {x = z| ≤ R}. In fact, by triangle inequalities, combined with dr ≥ diam 0h and diamT ≤ Ch for T ∈ Th, we obtain

$$\begin{aligned} \Omega\_h &= \bigcup\_{j=0}^J \Omega\_{h,j} \text{ (disjoint union)}, \quad \Omega\_{h0} \subset \Omega\_h \cap B(\mathbf{z}; 2d\_0), \\\Omega\_{h,j} &\subset \Omega\_h \cap A\_j^{(s)} \subset \Omega\_{h,j-1} \cup \Omega\_{h,j} \cup \Omega\_{h,j+1} =: \Omega\_{h,j}' \ (j \ge 1), \end{aligned}$$

where AS := A(z; (1 - 3)dj-1,(1 + s)d;) for all s € (0,1), provided that L is sufficiently large. We also remark that > =e de is bounded by Cdf, if a < 0, by C| log do| if a = 0, and by Cdf, if a > 0, for 0 ≤ l ≤ l ≤ l .

Now let us start the first part of the proof of Theorem 1.1. For any v6 € Vg we use the regularized delta function η constructed in Proposition 4.1 to get

$$(\tilde{u} - u\_h)(\mathbf{z}) = (\tilde{u} - v\_h)(\mathbf{z}) + (v\_h - \tilde{u}, \eta)\_{\Omega\_h} + (\tilde{u} - u\_h, \eta)\_{\Omega\_h}$$

The first two terms on the right-hand side are bounded by C | a - Un | [ ~ ( ( ) ~ ( ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ ( ) ~ regularized Green function g E W3,00 (0) by solving

$$-\Delta g = \eta \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega, \qquad g = 0 \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma,$$

where η is extended by zero outside suppη C Ω (this inclusion holds if h is small). We also utilize its finite element approximation gh E Vh obtained by solving

$$a\_h(v\_h, g\_h) = (\nabla v\_h, \nabla g\_h)\_{\Omega\_h} = (v\_h, \eta)\_{\Omega\_h} \quad \forall v\_h \in V\_h$$
