On removing the restriction from Bni, j = 0, 1, 2, ... , n in Corollary 4.1 i.e. Cho ≤ an1 ≤ ··· ≤ ank and for all Bni, in p(q) = ∑ ·· = q" am, , we have from (4.18)

$$\begin{aligned} |\xi\_1(q)| &\le \ \ \ MR^n \left\{ \sum\_{j=1}^k (|\alpha\_{n\_j} - \alpha\_{n\_{j-1}}| + |\beta\_{n\_j} - \beta\_{n\_{j-1}}|) + |\alpha\_{n\_0}| + |\beta\_{n\_0}| \right\} \\ &\le \ \ MR^n \left\{ (\alpha\_{n\_k} - \alpha\_{n\_0} + |\alpha\_{n\_0}|) + 2 \sum\_{j=0}^{k-1} |\beta\_{n\_j}| \right\} \\ \dots \end{aligned}$$

(4.23)

and on combining it with (4.20), we have the following;

Corollary 4.2. Let p E Pn with any = an; + Bn;i such that no two adjacent coefficients an , s are equal, i.e. an; = an;+1;j = 0,1,2, ··· , k and ano ≤ am² ≤ ···· ≤ an, and for all βα;, 0 ≤ j ≤ n. Further let Mn;, 1 ≤ j ≤ k with M as defined in Theorem 2.1. Then all the zeros lie in

$$(4.24) \qquad \qquad |q| \quad \le \quad \frac{M}{|a\_n|} \left\{ (\alpha\_n - \alpha\_0 + |\alpha\_0|) + 2 \sum\_{j=0}^{k-1} |\beta\_{n\_j}| + |\beta\_n| \right\}.$$

Setting Bri, = 0, j = 0, 1, ... , n and taking am; = an;, j = 0, 1, .. , n, we have the following result from Corollary 4.2.

Corollary 4.3. Let p(q) = >=0 q" an, such that no two adjacent coefficients ands are equal, i.e. an; ≠ an; +; j = 0,1,2, ··· , k and ano ≤ an; ≤ ··· ≤ am; · Further let Mn;, 1 ≤ j ≤ k with M as defined in Theorem 2.1. Then all the zeros of p(q) lie in

$$(4.25) \qquad \qquad \qquad |q| \quad \le \quad \frac{M}{|a\_n|} (\alpha\_n - \alpha\_0 + |\alpha\_0|).$$

## 5. CONCLUSION

Over the past ten years, the regular functions of the quaternionic variable have been introduced and thoroughly examined. Their diverse applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines have contributed significantly to their rapid development and have shown themselves to be a rich topic for investigation. We note that it became interesting to determine the regions containing some or all of the zeros of a regular polynomial of quaternionic variable following the study of the structure of zero sets and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra for regular polynomials. The distribution of zeros for polynomials with quaternionic variables and quaternionic coefficients was not well covered in the literature.Here, we derive regions that contain all of the zeros of a regular polynomial of a quaternionic variable when the structure of the zero sets established in the recently developed theory of regular functions and polynomials of a quaternionic variable, as well as a maximum modulus theorem, restrict the real and imaginary parts of its coefficients.
