of Hausdorff the metric. With one missing digit, Co.D is 1/N1/2(b)close to Co.D. Notice that Co.D is self-similar whose contraction ratio is 1/N1/2(b). From here, we see that the thickness of Co,D is at least caN1/2(b) for some constant cd > 0.

The thickness estimate holds for all Cb.D.; because of the self-similarity. However, we cannot directly use Theorem 11 to obtain intersections between different missing digit sets without checking the conditions (2,3).

Consider different integers b1, ... , bk E Z[i] with large enough norms so that Theorem 11 applies. Consider the logarithmic map

$$\log: a \in \mathbb{Z}[i] \to (\log|a|, \arg a) \in (0, \infty) \times \mathbb{T}.$$

The first component is the standard log for positive numbers. The second component is the argument of a as a complex number.3 For simplicity, let us first look at the two integers b1, b2. We claim that there are infinitely many positive rational integer pairs (11, 12) such that by /b/2 is close to one. In fact, consider the set

$$P = \{b\_1^{l\_1}/b\_2^{l\_2} : (l\_1, l\_2) \in \mathbb{Z}\_{>0}^2\} \subset \mathbb{C}.$$

<sup>31</sup>n general, such a logarithmic map can be defined in each Galois embedding individually.
