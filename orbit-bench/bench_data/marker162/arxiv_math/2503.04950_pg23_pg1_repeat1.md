Figure 6: An N-labeling of v = (4,3,3). The descents occur at cells (2,3), (3, 2), (3, 3) yielding maj(0) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 5. The inversion triples are formed by ((3, 2), (3, 3)), ((1, 2), (1, 3)), and ((1, 2), (1, 4)) yielding inv(o) = 3.

The reading order of a diagram v is the order on cells that goes left-to-right along rows starting from the top row and working down. The standardization of a labeling o : v -> N with content a = (an, c1, ·· ), denoted by st(o), is an injective labeling σ : v → {1, ··· , | |} that labels the 0's appearing in v 1,2, ··· , αρ in the order that they appear in the reading order. The 1's appearing in v are labeled on + 1, ·· , ag + a1 in reading order and so on. A triple consists of cells with row-column coordinates of the form u = (r,c), v = (r = 1, c) and w = (r, c + k) for r, c, k ≥ 1, where u, w must be cells of v, but v is allowed to be a cell immediately below v. Extend st(o) to cells immediately below v by labeling them -∞. A triple is an inversion triple of o if the labels st(0)(u),st(0)(v),st(0)(v) are decreasing clockwise. The statistic inv(r) counts the number of inversion triples of o.

A descent of o is a cell u = (r + 1, c) in v, such that v = (r, c) is also in v and o(u) > o(v). Letting Des(o) denote that set of descents we define the major index statistic

$$\operatorname{maj}(\sigma) := \sum\_{u \in \operatorname{Des}(\sigma)} (\log(u) + 1),$$

where leg(u) is the number of cells of v in the same column as u and above u. See Fig 6 for an example.

Lemma 5.2.1. The monomial coefficient ([d++] Hum) / mm) stabilizes once n ≥ max((p)++11+|q|+i, |n|+m].

Proof. Fix partitions µ, v and i, j and let M(n) denote the set of being enumerated in (26). Then

$$\langle [q^i t^j] H\_{\mu[n]}, h\_{\eta[n]} \rangle = |M^{(n)}|$$

and we wish to show |M(n)| stabilizes.

Suppose n ≥ |μ| + μ1 + |η| + i and π ≥ |η| + η1 so that μ[η] and η[η] are well-defined. Define the map Yo : M(n) >> M(n+1) as follows. For σ E M(n), shift the bottom row of the corresponding diagram to the right by one cell and insert a new cell labelled 0 in the bottom left corner. So for instance:

| Yn | T | 0 | 2 |   |        |   | 1<br>T | 0 | 2 |   |   |         |   |
|----|---|---|---|---|--------|---|--------|---|---|---|---|---------|---|
|    | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | T<br>T | 0 | 0      | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | -1<br>T | 0 |

We have to check that the map is well-defined and surjective. We claim that the first u1 +1 entries of the bottom row of any of E M(n+1) are 0. Suppose for contradiction that there was a non-zero value a among these first u1 +1 cells. Then there are at least n+1 - [u] +1) = n - [u] = n - [u] = n - [u] = n - [u] = n - [u] = n = [u] = p. of these, at most | | | - 1 are allowed to be non-zero (since a is one of the | | | non-zero values in the labeling). Hence a would contribute at least n - |u| - [] > i inversion triples formed by taking a, the phantom cell below it, and a 0 entry to the right of it. This contradicts that inv(o') = i for o' ∈ M(v+1).

This implies that if we let o be obtained from a o' E M(0+1) by deleting the bottom left cell and shifting the bottom row to the left by one, then o E M(1) and 7%(0) = 0', which implies that 7% is well-defined and bijective. Indeed, the first µ1 cells of the bottom row of o will be labeled 0 and so the status of descents and inversion triples doesn't change when going from o' to o. Thus, o' and o have the same inv and maj values.
