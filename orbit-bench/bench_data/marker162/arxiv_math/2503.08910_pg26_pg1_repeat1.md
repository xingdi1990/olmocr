We wonder whether the results of this section are valid when restricting to fams with the uap. These are not in general. For example, let a C w be the set of even numbers, 9 := P(w), let % be the field of sets over w generated by a and let F C P(w) be the filter of subsets of w containing {0,1}. Let 三 be the (unique) probability measure on 9 such that 三(a) = } (which is clearly uniformly supported). By Theorem 3.15, there is a unique probability fam 三 on (% U F) extending 三o such that 三(b) = 1 for all b E F, in particular, E({0,1}) = 1. Then, E({0}) = E(a (0,1}) = Ξo(a) = = and, naturally, E({1}) = }. However, E cannot have the uap because no singleton can have measure 2 under a probability fam with the uap (by Theorem 2.18). This also shows that Theorem 3.8 is not valid in general when restricting to the uap: both 三g and 三 are uniformly supported, but any common extension extends 三 and thus cannot have the uap.

We can validate Theorem 3.15 to fams with the uap under further conditions.

Theorem 3.16. In Theorem 3.15, assume that 9 = P(X) and that Bo contains all the finite subsets of X. If =0 has the uap, then so does =. Likewise for "uniformly supported".

Proof. If all finite sets have Eg-measure zero, then the same is true for E. So assume that 50 is uniformly supported with support P. Since 90 contains all finite sets, all finite sets in P with positive measure must be singletons (by minimality). It is not hard to show that P is a support of 三, so 三 is uniformly supported. -3.16

Similarly, we can validate the extension results when adding one set to the subalgebra.

Lemma 3.17. In the context of Lemma 3.11, assume that 9 = P(X) and that & contains all the singletons. Then, if E has the uap, then = can be found with the uap. As a consequence, 三 can be extended to a fam into K with the uap on the whole P(X).

Here, "uap" can be replaced by "uniformly supported", even more, extensions of E can be found with the same support.

Proof. The result is trivial when all singletons have E-measure zero. So assume that E is uniformly supported. The argument in the proof of Lemma 3.11, when replacing A by a support of 三, allows to find a uniformly supported 三' with the same support as 三. The rest follows by Zorn's Lemma. -3.17

We ask whether (iii) => (i) of Theorem 3.8 is valid when Eo and E1 have the uap for finding E with the uap, under the condition that both Bo and B1 contain all singletons. If, say, Eo is free then E1 and E must be free, but we do not know how to obtain an uniformly supported E when Eo and E1 are uniformly supported.

Question 3.18. Assume that Bo and B1 are fields of sets over X, containing all the singletons, and Eo and E1 are uniformly supported fams with the uap on Bo and B1, respectively. Assume that Eo and E1 are compatible (in the sense of Theorem 3.8 (iii)) Is there a uniformly supported fam that extends both 三o and 三1 ?

A strategy to solve this problem may suggest a short proof of Theorem 3.8.
