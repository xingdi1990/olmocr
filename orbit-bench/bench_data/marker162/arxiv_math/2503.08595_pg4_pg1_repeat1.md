dynamical delocalization result. However, assumption (1.3) is stronger than simply assuming the spectrum is AC, and this stronger assumption seems to be essentially necessary for ergodicity, see [7, Prp. 1.5] for a related result.

Some basic examples were given in [2, §3.2]: if v = 1, i.e. the fundamental cell is simply one vertex, then the limiting measure is uniform. This covers the continuous quantum walk eit on Zd and the triangular lattice for example. The same property is true for the hexagonal lattice and the infinite ladder, both of which have v = 2. It was also shown that in the cases where I is a 1d strip of width 3, or a cylinder Z C2, then the limiting distribution is not uniform.

1.2. Main results. In this note we analyze further families of graphs which satisfy our assumptions, and compute the limiting average (a)n explicitly.

We first give the following result, extracted from [7].

Proposition 1.2 (Case of Cartesian and Tensor Products). Suppose To is a periodic graph with v = 1 (for example To = Z4 or the triangular lattice), and let Gp be any finite graph with up = |GF vertices. Let I1 = ToOGp be the Cartesian product , I2 = To x GF be the tensor product and I3 = To & Gp be the strong product of To and Gp. Let En (0) be the band function of Co, (w;) an orthonormal eigenbasis of Ac; and (u;) the corresponding eigenvalues, j ≤ vp. Then

- (1) The band functions of Ar, are given by Ej(0) = Ero(0) + us.
- (2) The band functions of Ar2 are given by Ei(0) = ujEr,(0).
- (3) The band functions of Ars are given by E2(0) = (1 + ug)Ero(0) + Mj.
- (4) Assumption (1.3) is satisfied for Ar, but not necessarily for Ar2 or Arg.
- (5) For each of Ar, Ar2 and Ar3, we have

$$
\langle a \rangle\_p = \sum\_{q=1}^{\nu\_F} \langle a(\cdot + v\_q) \rangle \sum\_{s=1}^{\nu\_F'} |P\_{\mu\_s}(v\_p, v\_q)|^2,
$$

where Pus (Vp, Vq) = Σ μ;=μ;=μ;=μ; W;(vg) is the (kernel) of the orthogonal projection for the distinct eigenvalues of the finite graph.

For example, if To = Zd, then Er.(0) = 2 ∑=1 cos 2πθ; and if To is the triangular lattice, then Er,(0) = 2 cos 2πθ1 + 2 cos 2πθ2 + 2 cos 2π(01 + 02), for θε ∈ (0, 1). Here Σ 1,2,3 are viewed as periodic graphs with fundamental domain containing up vertices, cf. [7] Lemma 3.1, §3.4], with (v2) the vertices of GF.

Arguing as before, we get for these more special graphs that

$$(1.6)\qquad\qquad\mu\_{T,v\_p+\mathbf{n\_a}}^N(\mathbf{k\_a}+v\_q) \approx \frac{1}{N^d} \sum\_{s=1}^{\nu} |P\_{\mu\_s}(v\_p, v\_q)|^2 =: \frac{1}{N^d} d(p,q)\dots$$

whenever (1.3) is satisfied. This gives a more satisfactory concept of a quantum limiting distribution than in [7] where quantum ergodicity was assessed by the behaviour of eigenvector bases, and it was shown in [7, §4.5] that such a limiting distribution depends on the eigenvector basis. In contrast, here the RHS of (1.6) depends only on the graph.

Our main target now is to compute the weights d(p,q) for specific finite graphs Gr. Because of point (4) above, the theorems are illustrated only for the Cartesian product, but some hold more generally. For definiteness, the reader can assume I o = Z in all these results, which is already interesting. However, nothing changes for any I o having a single vertex in its fundamental domain, such as Zd and the triangular lattice.

A nice simplification in the family of Cartesian products is that the limiting weight d(p, q) in (1.6) depends only on the finite graph GF, compared to the general case (1.5), where the weight depends on the full Floquet matrix and computations become more daunting. Still, as we will see, Cartesian products already offer interesting contrasting
