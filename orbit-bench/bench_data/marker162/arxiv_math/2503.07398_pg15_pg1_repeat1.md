Proof. The result follows from the observation that

$$\text{rk}(\mathbb{1}\_A^{C\_0 \oplus C\_1}) = \text{rk}(\mathbb{1}\_A^{C\_0} \oplus \mathbb{1}\_A^{C\_1}) \ge \text{rk}(\mathbb{1}\_A^{C\_0}),$$

for any measurable subset A of X .

Observe that Ax(X) does not necessarily contains a faithful X-module. For instance, if X has N1 coarsely connected components, no coarse X-module of rank No can be faithful. However, it is possible to fully characterise the cardinals for which the approximable category contains a faithful module.

Lemma 2.10. Let X be a LFCM space with an infinite discrete partition. For any two discrete partitions {Ai}ier and {Bi}jeJ, the cardinalities of I and J are equal. Moreover, for an infinite cardinal k, the following statements are equivalent:

- (1) K is greater than or equal to the cardinality of a discrete partition of X;
- (2) Ak(X) contains a faithful X-module;
- (3) AK(X) contains an ample X-module.

Proof. Since {A; vier is a discrete partition of X, for each j E J, there exist only finitely many i ∈ I such that B; n A; ≠ 0. Consequently, |J ≤ |I × No. Similarly, one has | | ≤ |J × No. Note that if X admits an infinite discrete partition, then any discrete partition of X must also be infinite. It follows that

$$|I| = |I| \times \aleph\_0 = |J| \times \aleph\_0 = |J|.$$

For the second part of the statement, note that every ample X-module is necessarily faithful. Conversely, given a faithful X-module C, let H be a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Define the X-module C & H, where the underlying Hilbert space is Hc & H and the representation 1 CoH is given by 1200 = 19 @idg for all subsets A. It is straightforward to verify that C & H is an ample X-module with the same rank as C.

It remains to establish the equivalence of (1) and (2). If k exceeds the cardinality of the discrete partition, then the module constructed in Example 2.1 is a faithful X-module of rank || . Conversely, suppose C is a faithful X-module of rank K. Define Ic = {i ∈ I | A; O dom1(C) ≠ Ø} ≤ I. By discretising X and dom1(C), there exists a gauge E E E I such that

$$I = E[I\_C] = \bigcup\_{i \in I\_C} E[\{i\}].$$

It follows that the cardinality of I is given by |C | x supjer |E[{{}]]. Since |E[{{}] is finite for all i E I, we deduce |I = |Ic |.

We shall focus on the case of countably generated LFCM spaces. Accordingly, we aim to determine the cardinals & for which the approximable category Ax(X) contains a faithful X-module. The following lemma addresses this question in the connected case.

Lemma 2.11. If X is a countably generated LFCM space with a countable number of connected components, then Axo(X) contains a faithful X-module.

Proof. Let {Ai}jer be a discrete partition of X. By considering the discretisation Z = (I, & , P(I)) of X, as in Proposition 1.9, we obtain a locally finite, countably generated coarse space. We may select a generating set {En}neN for I satisfying the following conditions:

- (1) For every n E N, the inclusion En C En+1 holds;
- (2) For every n E N, the entourage En is a gauge;
- (3) For every entourage F E E1, there exists n E N such that F C En.

Since I has a countable amount of connected components, there exists a sequence { ik }ken < I such that for every j ∈ J there are n, k ∈ N such that (ik, j) ∈ En. As Z is locally finite, the sets En [ia] are finite for all n,k E N. Hence,

$$I = \bigcup\_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup\_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E\_n[i\_k]$$

is at most countable. Consequently, X admits a countable discrete partition. By Lemma 2.10, the approximable category Axo(X) contains a faithful X-module.

In the case where X has an uncountable number of connected components, the theorem above does not hold. For instance, consider an uncountable disjoint union of copies of N, equipped with an extended metric

$$d(n,m) = \begin{cases} |n-m|, & \text{if } n,m \text{ belong to the same copy of } \mathbb{N};\\ \infty, & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$
