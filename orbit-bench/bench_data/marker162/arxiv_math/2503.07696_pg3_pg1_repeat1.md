Throughout we assume the Riemann Hypothesis, in the strong form that the nontrivial zeros are also simple. We also need to assume the following:

Hypothesis D. The level curves Re(n(s)) = 0 are differentiable. This is automatic except at isolated points where η' (s) = 0, so we are really assuming that when n'(s) = 0, arg(n(s)) = ±π/2. This prevents the level curves from branching. Hypothesis D is plausible because ±n/2 are only two points on the unit circle, while the zeros of η' (s) form a countable set.

Here's a summary of the sections of the paper:

- \$1 Classification of the zeros of {(s) and {(s) into different types by means of the level curves, and results on the asymptotics of the types.
- §2 Computation and classification of 106 zeros of 7 (s) near T = 1010.
- §3 Two lemmas.
- §4 A closer look at the type 2 zeros, and the curvature of the level curve.
- §5 A canonical bijection between the complex zeros p' of {'(s), and the complex zeros p" of g"(s).
- §6 Adaptation of a theorem of Marden, and the location of o" relative to p' .
- §7 Curvature of the level curve at ρ' in terms of all the other zeros N + p'.
- §8 Appendix: With pa(z) the characteristic polynomial of a unitary matrix A, we give a classification of the zeros of PA(Z) and p' (z) analogous to that in §1.

## 1. CLASSIFICATION OF ZEROS

Proposition 1. With the usual indexing Y1 < Y2 < ... of the imaginary parts of the zeros of ζ(s), every odd indexed zero lies on a contour Im(n(s)) < 0. Every even indexed zero lies on a contour Im(n(s)) > 0.

Proof. This follows from Lemma 2 below, which says that as t increases, the argument of n(1/2 + it) decreases by exactly n between
