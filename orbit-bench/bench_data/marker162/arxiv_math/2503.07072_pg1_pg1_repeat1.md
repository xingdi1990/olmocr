## Abstract

The problem of determining the maximum number of copies of T in an H-free graph, for any graphs T and H, was considered by Alon and Shikhelman. This is a variant of Turán's classical extremal problem. We show lower and upper bounds for the maximum number of s-cliques in a graph with no disjoint copies of arbitrary graph. We also determine the maximum number of s-cliques in an n-vertex graph that does not contain a disjoint union of k paths of length two when k = 2, 3, or s ≥ k + 2, or n is sufficiently large, this partly confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang [1].

## 1. Introduction

A graph G is said to be H-free if it does not contain any subgraph isomorphic to H . The classical extremal function ex (n, H) denoted as ex(n, H), is formally defined as the maximum number of edges on an n-vertex H-free graph. This function extends naturally to a scenario where the objective is not merely to maximize the number of edges, but rather to maximize the number of copies of a specified graph 7 within an n-vertex graph that is H-free. In accordance with the notation introduced by Alon and Shikhelman [2], the more general function is denoted as ex(n, T, H), which is commonly referred to the generalized Turán number of H. Let Py be the path with k vertices. Obviously, ex(n, P2, H) = ex(n, H). We denote the cycle with & vertices by Ce and the complete graph with s vertices by Ks.

The exploration of such problems dates back to the foundational work of Erdős [3], who established the values of ex(n, Ks, Kt) for any two cliques. After these seminal discoveries, a series of related findings were made, with one of the most notable being the resolution of ex(n, C5, C3) by Hatami et al. [4], and Grzesik [5], each working independently. A wealth of additional research has further expanded our understanding of generalized extremal numbers, as evidenced by various studies referenced in the literature |6, 7, 8, 9|.

Scholars have studied the generalized Turán numbers for the vertex-disjoint union of graphs. Let kH represent the collection of k disjoint copies of the graph H. Gerbner, Methuku, and Vizer |10| delved into the function ex(n, T, kH), where H
