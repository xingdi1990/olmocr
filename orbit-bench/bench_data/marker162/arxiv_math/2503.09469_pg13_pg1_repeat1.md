therefore, \1(B-woC') = (V1(B),(B - woC')(V1(B))) = 2p1-wo& since C' E C. So the strict inequality is asserting that 2μ1 - ως < λι(13 - ως ). However, the arguments in Lemmas 4 and 5, that apply to C\* (since C\* E C), show that ) (B - wC\*) is a concave function of w and that the linear function 241 - w is an upper bound for it. This violates the strict inequality in: 11(B - woC') = 241 - wo& < x1(B-WOC\*) ≤ 2p1 - Wo §.

Let S denote the two dimensional subspace spanned by V (B) and V and C's denote the restriction of C' to this subspace (i.e., C' agrees with C' for any vector in this subspace and assigns 0 to any element outside). Also V1(B - woC') E S by the definition of V and À1(B - w0C's) = ^1(B - woC').

Since C' E C, its restriction to S satisfies (V1(B),C's(V1(B))) = E. Also, Co < B/2. To satisfy the kissing constraint in Properties 2, we can add a component along V : C' : = C' + V & V E C for some & ≥ 0. Since C' > C's we have λι(B-ωοC's) ≤ λι(B-ωοC's). Proposition 3 establishes C\* ↑ C's, a relationship that applies to all w E [0, 2], that guarantees:

$$
\lambda\_1(\mathfrak{B} - \omega\_0 \mathfrak{C}^\*) \le \lambda\_1(\mathfrak{B} - \omega\_0 \mathfrak{C}\_S^{\prime\prime}) \le \lambda\_1(\mathfrak{B} - \omega\_0 \mathfrak{C}\_S^{\prime}).
$$

This is in contradiction with the strict inequality x1(B - woC\*) > >1(B - woc').

Proof of Theorem 1. Theorem 2 implies \1(B\* - wC\*) = x1(B-wC\*) ≤ }1(B-wC) for w E (0,2) that establishes C(w) ≥ xmax(A(w)) based on (14). The covariance Zk converges to 0 according to the rate given by Amax(A(w)) and the expected error at each step is the trace of Σκ. Β []|εκ. [] = tr Σκ. When i is drawn independently and identically distributed at each step of (1), the geometric rate of convergence is bound by C(w) for every w E [0, 2]. 

## 4.4 Perron-Frobenius Theory For Positive Linear Maps

The superoperator A defined in (7) plays the role of the iteration matrix — whose spectrum provides convergence analysis in classical iterative methods [Saad, 2003] - for randomized iterations. In this section we discuss the theoretical foundations that provide necessary properties on the spectrum of A in the covariance analysis we have seen.

Recall the superoperator A, for a fixed w, denotes a linear map over the space of n x n matrices as:

$$\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{m} \sum\_{i=1}^{m} (I - \omega \mathbf{P}\_i) \mathbf{X} (I - \omega \mathbf{P}\_i) .$$

Since orthogonal projection is a symmetric operator, for any symmetric positive semi-definite matrix X the operation (I - WP ;) X (I - wP ;) preserves its positivity |Bhatia, 2009]. Hence the superoperator A is a positive linear map, leaving the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices invariant.

The spectra of positive linear maps on general (noncommutative) matrix algebras was studied in [Evans and Høegh-Krohn, 1978] that generalized the Perron-Frobenius theorem to this context. The spectral radius of a positive linear map is attained by an eigenvalue for which there exists an eigenvector that is positive semi-definite (see Theorem 6.5 in [Wolf, 2012]). The notion of irreducibility for positive linear maps guarantees that the eigenvalue is simple and the corresponding eigenvector is well-defined (up to a sign). What is more is that the eigenvector can be chosen to be a positive definite matrix. This guarantees that the power iterations in (7) converge along this positive definite matrix with the corresponding simple eigenvalue giving the rate of convergence.

For a system of equations in Ax = b, we examine the irreducibility of its corresponding superoperator A for any given relaxation value w. The criteria for irreducibility of positive linear maps was developed in [Farenick, 1996] and involve invariant subspaces. A collection S of (closed) subspaces of the vector space of n x n matrices is called trivial if it only contains {0} and the space itself. Given a bounded linear operator M, let Lat(M) denote the invariant subspace lattice of M. The following theorem is a specialization of a more general result in [Farenick, 1996] (see Theorem 2) to our superoperator.

Theorem 3 (Irreducibility of the superoperator A). The positive linear map A is irreducible if and only if, ( = Lat ( I - wPi) is trivial.

Based on this theorem, we establish the equivalence of the irreducibility of A, in the sense of positive linear maps, to a geometric notion of irreducibility defined for alternating projections (2) that is inherently a geometric approach to solving a system of equations Ax = b. We recall the Frobenius notion of irreducibility for symmetric matrix M is called irreducible if it can not be transformed to block diagonal form by a permutation matrix II:

$$M = \Pi \begin{bmatrix} M' & \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} & M'' \end{bmatrix} \Pi^{-1},$$
