FIGURE 3. The decorated fan of an action of Q(1)2 on P212

Example 4.28. Let us use Proposition 4.26 and Corollary 4.27 to classify toric supervarieties with supertorus (1)™ and underlying variety IP" = Xs for the complete fan whose rays are pi = R+x; for i = 1, ... , n and po = R+(-x1 - ... - xm).

For i = 1, ... , n, the ray p; must be decorated by a subspace Vg, such that [Vg, V2] ≤ Cx;. Hence Vg = C&; or 0. Likewise, unless V% = 0, we have Vw = C(01 + 02 ± ... ± 02,)
for some 20-1 choices of ±.

It is straightforward to verify that condition (b) of the definition of a large-orbit decorated fan holds regardless of which subspaces are chosen. We therefore obtain a collection of 2"(1 +2"-1) toric supervarieties which are not equivariantly isomorphic. Many, however, are isomorphic via toric morphisms (to be defined in the following section).

Notice that if all but one of these decorations is nonzero, then the decorated fan describes a supervariety isomorphic to projective superspace IPMP. For instance, if Vg, = CA; and Vo, = 0, then the coordinate superalgebras of the affine charts can be written as

$$\mathbb{C}[t\_1, \ldots, t\_n, t\_1\xi\_1, \ldots, t\_n\xi\_n]$$

and

$$\mathbb{C}[t\_i^{-1}t\_1, \dots, t\_i^{-1}, \dots, t\_i^{-1}t\_n\xi\_1, \dots, \xi\_i, \dots, t\_i^{-1}t\_n\xi\_n].$$

Figure 3 depicts the corresponding decorated fan for n = 2,

If instead we change the decoration of 00 to 01 + ... + 0%, then the resulting affine charts have coordinate superalgebras

$$
\mathbb{C}[t\_1, \ldots, t\_n, t\_1\xi\_1, \ldots, t\_n\xi\_n]
$$

and

$$\mathbb{C}[t\_i^{-1}t\_1(1+\xi\_i\xi\_1),\ldots,t\_i^{-1},\ldots,t\_i^{-1}t\_n(1+\xi\_i\xi\_n),t\_i^{-1}t\_1(\xi\_i-\xi\_1),\ldots,t\_i^{-1}\xi\_i,\ldots,t\_i^{-1}t\_n(\xi\_i-\xi\_n)],$$

so the supervariety is decidedly not isomorphic to projective superspace. Figure 4(B) depicts corresponding decorated fan for n = 1.

In general, when T = Q(1)", there are finitely many possible decorations for each ray. Namely, for p = R+(a1x1 + ... + anwn), there are 2d-1 many possible "square root subspaces" C( ( ( a f 0 + ... ± √ a 0 m), where d is the number of indices i = 1, ... , n for which ai = 0.

The prior example admitted no issues of compatibility between different rays of the same cone. This is not ordinarily the case; if p1 = R+(a1x1 + ... + anxn) and p2 = R + ( + .. + bn x ), compatibility is less common if the linear matroid on the n vectors

$$
\begin{pmatrix} a\_1 \\ b\_1 \end{pmatrix}, \dots, \begin{pmatrix} a\_n \\ b\_n \end{pmatrix}
$$
