Before turning to the proof of Theorem 3.15, we gather a few facts relating hyperplanes and relative contact complexes.

Proposition 3.17. Let X be a quasi-median graph and G be a collection of gated subgraphs. For a finite collection of hyperplanes J of X, the following statements are equivalent:

- · J is a simplex of Cont-(X,G);
- · there exists Y E G and x E Y N (JE7 N(J) such that Y contains the clique of J containing x for each J E J .

Moreover, if G is a star-covering collection of gated subgraphs, the above statements are equivalent to:

· for every x E (1), there exists Y E G that contains the clique of J containing x for each J E J .

Proof. Suppose J = {J1, ... , Jn} is a simplex of Cont-(X,G). Then there exists Y E G such that { N(J1), ... , N(Jn)} U {Y } is a collection of pairwise intersecting gated subgraphs, and the Helly property implies that Y N Ji is non-empty. Let x E Y ON == N ( Ji). Since Ji crosses Y, the clique of J2 contained in Y by Corollary 2.6. That the second and third statements imply the first one follows directly from the definitions.

Let us prove that the first statement implies the third one assuming that G is starcovering. Let J = {J1,..., Jn} be a simplex of Cont-(X,G) and x E (1c7 N(J). The hyperplanes in J are pairwise in contact, and there exists Z E G such that each J E J crosses Z. If x E Z O ( ; , N ( ), then Corollary 2.6 implies that the clique of J containing x is contained in Z for each J E J; in this case, it suffices to set Y := Z. Suppose that x & ZNN =1 N (Jx) and let J be a hyperplane separating x from Z, which we can choose to be tangent to x. Let C be the clique of J containing x. Since G is star-covering, there exists Y E G containing all the prisms that contain C. For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let C; be the clique of J; containing x. Since J is necessarily transverse to Ji, Proposition 2.10 implies that C and Ci span a prism containing x, and hence Cis contained in Y. L

The rest of the section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 3.15. We fix a quasi-median graph X and a collection G of gated subgraphs. The equivalence of the two statements of Theorem 3.15 will be proven in Lemma 3.20 by showing that for each vertex x ∈ X, sL(x) is homotopy equivalent to La(x).

Let X o be the perforation of X, i.e. the space obtained from the prism-completion X = of X by removing a small open ball around each vertex of a fixed radius e < 1/2, if we endow X - with a length metric that extends the Euclidean metrics on its prisms. Given a vertex x E X, the sphere S(x, e) can be identified with the link of x in the prismcompletion X-. In other words, we can think of S(x, e) as the simplicial complex whose vertices are the edges of X containing x and whose simplices are given by collections of edges contained in a common prism of X.

When G is prism-covering, the complex La (x) naturally contains S(x, e) as a subcomplex, which allows us to define

$$X^{\mathbb{G}} := X^{\mathbb{G}} \cup \bigcup\_{x \in X} \mathcal{L}\_{\mathbb{G}}(x)$$

where each La (x) is glued to X over S(x, e).
