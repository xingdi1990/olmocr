By compactness we can now cover the interval [a, b] with a finite number of such neighborhoods Ux1, . . . . , Uxx C R. If

$$N(\text{3.1}) \qquad V := N(T(\lambda\_1)^\*) + N(T(\lambda\_2)^\*) + \dots + N(T(\lambda\_n)^\*) \subset L^\infty(\mathbb{R}),$$

then dim V < ∞ and R(T(X)) + V = L∞(R) for all 入 ∈ [a, b].

(IV) This step is inspired by Step 3 in the proof of [41, Thm. 5.3]. Keeping T > 0 fixed, consider the family of operators

$$S(\lambda) : D(S(\lambda)) \to L^{\infty}[-\tau, \tau], \qquad \qquad [S(\lambda)y](t) := \dot{y}(t) - A(t, \lambda)y(t)$$

for a.a. t E [-7, 7], which due to Lemma 2.1(a) is well-defined on the domain

$$D(S(\lambda)) := \left\{ u \in W^{1,\infty}[-\tau,\tau] \mid u(-\tau) \in N(P^-\_{\lambda}(-\tau)), \ u(\tau) \in R(P^+\_{\lambda}(\tau)) \right\}.$$

(IV.1) Claim: dim N (S( ) ) = dim N (T( ) ) < ∞. Consider the commutative diagram

where p is the restriction of functions in L80(R) to L80[-7, 7] given by p(u) := w|--7,7] and a canonical map ix : D(S(X)) -> W1,8(R) defined by extending a given function u E D(S(A)) to the intervals (-00, -7) and (7, 00) as solution of (V)). Observe that ix is injective and ix(N(S(X))) = N(T(A)) holds, where ix(N(S(X))) ≤ N(T(X)) results directly due to the construction of ix, while ix (N(S(A))) ≥ N(T(X)) as converse inclusion follows from the fact that privided u E N(T(X)), then u(T) E R(P+(T)) and u(-7) E N(PT(-7)) for any 7 > 0 (recall (2.3)). Finally, this yields the assertion.

(IV.2) We decompose [-T, T] = [-T, 0] U [0, T] and define the spaces

$$\begin{aligned} X\_+ &:= \{ u \in W^{1,\infty}[0,\tau] \mid u(\tau) \in R(P\_\lambda^+(\tau)) \}, & Y\_+ &:= L^\infty[0,\tau], \\ X\_- &:= \{ u \in W^{1,\infty}[-\tau,0] \mid u(-\tau) \in N(P\_\lambda^-(-\tau)) \}, & Y\_- &:= L^\infty[-\tau,0]. \end{aligned}$$

Consider the following linear operators S=( ) : X + -> Y pointwise defined as

$$S^{\pm}(\lambda)y[(t) = \dot{y}(t) - D\_2f(t, \phi\_\lambda(t), \lambda)y(t) \quad \text{for a.e. } t \in \mathbb{R}\_{\pm}.$$

Next consider the following commutative diagram

$$(\text{3.3}) \qquad \qquad \qquad \begin{aligned} X\_- &\oplus X\_+ \xrightarrow{S^-(\lambda) \oplus S^+(\lambda)} Y\_- \oplus Y\_+ \\\\ D(S(\lambda)) &\xrightarrow{S(\lambda)} L^\infty[-\tau, \tau], \end{aligned}$$

where J : L ( ( - 7, 7 -> Y \_ @ Y + and Jx : D(S( ) -> X \_ @ X + are defined by

Ju := (u\_, u+) and Jxv := (v\_, v+)

with u+ and v+ (resp. u\_ and v\_) being the corresponding restrictions to [0, 7] (resp. to the interval |-7,0|). It is clear that J is an isomorphism, while Jx is injective with range R(Jx) = {(v\_, v+) | v\_(0) = v+(0)}. Defining the mapping Σ: X\_ @ X+ -> Rd by
