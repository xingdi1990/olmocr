Theorem 1.6 (Bars [5]). The modular curve Xo(N) has infinitely many points of degree 2 over Q if and only if

N € { 1 - 33, 35 - 37, 39 - 41, 43, 46 - 50, 53, 59, 61, 65, 71, 79, 83, 89, 101, 131 },

Theorem 1.7 (Jeon [18]). The modular curve Xo(N) has infinitely many points of degree 3 over Q if and only if

N E {1 - 29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 43, 45, 49, 50, 54, 64, 81 }.

Theorem 1.8 (Hwang, Jeon; Derickx, Orlić [17, 11]). The modular curve Xo(N) has infinitely many points of degree 4 over Q if and only if

N € {1 - 75, 77 - 83,85 - 89, 91, 92, 94 - 96, 98 - 101, 103, 104, 107, 111, 118, 119, 121, 123, 125, 128, 131, 141 - 143, 145, 155, 159, 167, 191 }.

From these results, it is easy to determine the modular curves of the form Xo(N) with density degree 1, 2, 3 and 4. For example, Xo(N) has density degree 4 if and only if N occurs in the set of Theorem 1.8 but not in the sets of Theorems 1.6 and 1.7. Motivated by the recent work of Kadets and Vogt [23] on density degrees, we determine all curves Xo(N) with density degree equal to 5. Our main result is the following theorem:

Theorem 1.9. The modular curve Xo(N) has density degree min(δ(Xn(N)/Q)) equal to 5 if and only if N = 109.

This main theorem is an important step in determining all curves Xo(N) with infinitely many quintic points. In fact, if a curve has infinitely many quintic points, then it has to have density degree ≤ 5. And our result completes the classification of all modular curves of density degree < 5. So, in order to determine all curves Xn(N) with infinitely many quintic points, it suffices to determine for the explicit list Xo(N) of density degree < 4 whether they have infinitely many quints. With some extra work, we are able to prove the following:

Theorem 1.10. The modular curve Xo(N) has infinitely many points of degree 5 for

N € {1 - 45,47 - 58,61,63,64,65,67,68,72,73,75,80,81,91,109,121,125}.

The modular curve Xo(N) has only finitely many points of degree 5 for N ≥ 192 and

N € {46,59,60,62,66,69,70,71,76,78,84,87,90,93,94,95,97,102,104,105, 106, 108, 110, 112 - 117, 119, 120, 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 130, 132 - 140, 144, 146 - 154, 156, 157, 158, 160 - 166, 168 - 190}.

Remark 1.11. With the above theorem, there are 30 levels N for which we do not know yet if there are infinitely many quintic points. These levels are

> {74,77,79,82,83,85,86,88,89,92,96,98,99,100,101,103,107, 111, 118, 123, 128, 131, 141, 142, 143, 145, 155, 159, 167, 191}.
