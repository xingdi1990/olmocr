for the Dirichlet form associated to sticky Brownian motion. Denoting ao = = == and bo = wao, for all s > 0 we have

$$\begin{aligned} \int f^2 \, \mathrm{d}\mu &= a\_0 (f(0)^2 + f(L)^2) + b\_0 \int\_0^L f^2 \, \mathrm{d}x, \\ &\le a\_0 (f(0)^2 + f(L)^2) + b\_0 s \int\_0^L (f')^2 \, \mathrm{d}x + b\_0 \beta(s) \left( \int\_0^L |f| \, \mathrm{d}x \right)^2, \\ &\le b\_0 s \int\_0^L (f')^2 \, \mathrm{d}x + b\_0 \max(b\_0^{-2}, a\_0^{-1}) \beta(s) \left( \int |f| \, \mathrm{d}\mu \right)^2. \end{aligned}$$

Therefore the sticky Brownian satisfies a super Poincaré inequality. Then by |Wan00, Th. 5.1|, it has an empty essential spectrum. Now, by |BGL14, Th. A.6.4|, the resolvent is compact and thus the generator has discrete spectrum. 

Corollary 19. Choosing T = m-1/2, the transition semigroup of the RTP process is exponentially contractive in T-average with rate

$$\nu = \Omega \left( \frac{\omega}{1 + (\omega L)^2} \right).$$

Note that the relaxation time corresponding to this decay rate is of the same order as the mixing time obtained in |GHM24|. It reveals the existence of two regimes controlled by the parameter wL. In the ballistic regime wL < 1, velocity flips are rare, leading to a fast exploration of the position space S and a comparatively slow exploration of the velocity space V. This results in the scaling v x w. On the contrary, in the diffusive regime wL > 1, the high frequency of velocity flips makes the exploration of V faster than the exploration of S. This leads to the scaling v x w-1L-2.

Proof. We begin by verifying Assumption (A). Recall that Dom(Loo) is a core of £ by Theorem 7. For all f E Dom(Lco) we have Lo(f o T) = 0 hence Ltt is a lift of L by Remark 8. Furthermore, for f E Dom(Lro) one has

$$
\ddot{\mathcal{L}}\_{\text{tr}}^\*(f \diamond \pi)(x, v) = -v \mathbf{1}\_{\{0 < x < L\}} f'(x) = -\ddot{\mathcal{L}}\_{\text{tr}}(f \diamond \pi)(x, v).
$$

A straightforward computation yields

$$\int\_{\mathcal{V}} \hat{\mathcal{L}}\_v f(x, v) \, \mathrm{d}\kappa\_x(v) = 0 \text{ for all } x \in \mathcal{S} \text{ and } f \in \mathrm{Dom}(\hat{\mathcal{L}}).$$

Finally, we prove ||f - ILof ||2200 ≤ ≤ (f) with mo = 2. Define the matrices

$$S = \begin{pmatrix} 1/4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1/4 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mathcal{Q} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & -2 \end{pmatrix},$$

as well as the scalar product (x,y)s = x Sy and let II be the orthogonal projection on the kernel of Q with respect to (.; ) c. The matrix Q is symmetric w.r.t. the scalar
