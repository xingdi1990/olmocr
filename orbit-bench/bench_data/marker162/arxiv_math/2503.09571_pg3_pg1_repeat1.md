## 2 The Mandelstam Region

A symmetric n x n matrix S = [s;; | of rank r is said to be a Mandelstam matrix if

- · the diagonal entries are non-negative, sij ≥ 0 for i = 1, ... , n; and
- · it has precisely one positive eigenvalue and r 1 negative eigenvalues.

We denote the set of all Mandelstam matrices of rank r by Mn.r. This is a semialgebraic set in 限("2), the space of all symmetric matrices. The following is the Mandelstam analogue of the familiar characterization of positive semidefinite matrices in terms of principal minors.

Lemma 2.1. A symmetric n x n matrix S is Mandelstam if and only if

$$(-1)^{|I|-1} \det(S\_I) \ge 0 \qquad \text{for all } I \subseteq [n],\tag{4}$$

where det(Sr) are the principal minors of S.

Proof. This follows from the general results in [6]. We refer to Baker's exposition in [3]. The key step is Cauchy's interlacing theorem [12]. This states that the eigenvalues of Sr interlace the eigenvalues of S7 whenever I C J. Hence, if Sr has at most one positive eigenvalue then so does S ;. But S ; cannot have all negative eigenvalues because its trace is non-negative.

The name of our matrices refers to the physicist Stanley Mandelstam (1928–2016) who is credited for introducing the variables sij in the context of scattering amplitudes. In [14] the role of Mn.r as a kinematic space is recognized. A term more familiar to mathematicians might be "Lorentzian matrices." These encode Lorentzian quadratic forms [5, 6]. We here use the term Lorentzian matrix for a Mandelstam matrix whose entries sij are all non-negative.

Mandelstam matrices arise as Gram matrices of momentum vectors in 限++d with the Lorentzian inner product. A non-zero momentum vector p E R++4 of the form

$$p = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} 1, x\_1, \dots, x\_d \end{pmatrix},\tag{5}$$

for some scalar \ / 0, and x = (x1, . . , xa) in the closed unit ball Bd = {x ∈ Rd : || ≤ 1}. Given n momentum vectors, p(0), their Gram matrix S = [si;] has entries si; = p(0). This is the matrix in (1). The entries of S may now be written as

$$s\_{ij} \;=\; \lambda\_i \lambda\_j \left(1 - \langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)} \rangle \right) \tag{6}$$

Here · is the Lorentz inner product on 限+d and ( , ) is the Euclidean inner product on 限4

Lemma 2.2. A symmetric n x n matrix S is Mandelstam, i.e. S lies in the region Mn.<1+d if and only if it is the Gram matrix of n momentum vectors in (1+d)-dimensional spacetime.

Proof. Assume that S has no zero rows or columns. For the only-if direction, take a Mandelstam matrix S. By Lemma 2.1 and diagonalization of symmetric matrices, it can be factorized as in (1). Namely, we write S = MDMT, where D = diag(1, -1, -1, -1). Let the
