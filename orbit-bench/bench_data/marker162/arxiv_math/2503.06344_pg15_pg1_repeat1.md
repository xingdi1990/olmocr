Remark 3.15. Another interesting situation is when we have two foliated manifolds (M, FM) and (N, FM), and a local diffeomorphism - say, a covering map - F : M -> N which sends leaves of FM into leaves of FN, and we want to move affine information between them. Note that Fx maps FM -vertical vectors into FN-vertical vectors, but not necessarily surjectively. It will become clear that it is necessary that only JM-vertical vectors are mapped into FN-vertical vectors. For example, consider id : R3 → R3, where the first R3 is foliated by TF1 = R , and the second one is foliated by TF2 = 限品 @ 限 .. It is clear that id is a foliated diffeomorphism. The usual flat connection 740 of R3 is a transverse affine connection to both foliations, albeit associated with different partner connections w1 and w2 (each of them is just restricted to the respective vertical distributions). However, id\* 7fat = 74at and id\* w2 = w2, which does not result in a transverse affine connection in the source foliation.

To achieve our goal, we must require furthermore that J-10 and F-1 are of the same dimension, so that vertical vectors on TM are in one-to-one correspondence with the vertical vectors in TN. Indeed, if (N, FN) is endowed with a transverse affine connection VM, we can define the pullback F\*Q" as follows: for X,Y EX(M), we set (F\*Q")xY = Z, where Z is given by: For p = M, let U be any neighborhood of p for which Φ := F\v is a diffeomorphism onto its (open) image. Then, Z(p) := ddg - ( v x x x ) , . If w" is the partner connection associated with �^, then we can check that, for any V ∈ X(FM) and any X ∈ X(M) we have

$$\begin{aligned} (F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N)\_X V &= (F^\*\omega^N)\_X V, \\ (F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N)\_V X &= [V,X] + (F^\*\omega^N)\_X V. \end{aligned}$$

As for the holonomy invariance condition, given V E X(FM), and X, Y E L(FM) we have

$$(\mathcal{L}\_V(F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N))(X,Y) = [V,(F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N)\_X Y] - (F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N)\_{[V,X]} Y - (F^\*\hat{\nabla}^N)\_X [V,Y].$$

Note that the two properties that we already established imply that the two last terms above are vertical. As for the first one, note that since F is locally a diffeomorphism, on a neighborhood of each point we can write V = Φ-(W) for some W ∈ X(F"). Then we are left with

$$\left[V,(F^\*\hat\nabla^N)\_X Y\right] = \left[\Phi^{-1}\_\*(W),\Phi^{-1}\_\*\left(\hat\nabla^N\_{\Phi\_\*X}\Phi\_\*Y\right)\right] = \Phi^{-1}\_\*\left[W,\hat\nabla^N\_{\Phi\_\*X}\Phi\_\*Y\right],$$

which is vertical because 201 is a transverse affine connection and & stablishes a one-to-one correspondence between vertical vectors.

In the converse direction, if now (M, JM) is given a transverse affine connection VM, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the pushforward via F is oneto-one, (that is, a full diffeomorphism). When this is the case, we can set the pushforward (FxV )xY = W, for X,Y E X(N), where W is constructed as: given q E N, let U be any neighborhood of p = F-1(q) for which Φ := Flu is a diffeomorphism. Put W (q) := dop (Vorx®\*Y) . As before, since vertical vectors in TM and in TN are in bijection, we obtain that F \$11 is a transverse affine connection with partner connection given by F w204

The next important consistency check arises by considering semi-Riemannian foliations. We show that any one such gives rise to a unique transverse affine structure - a result that works as an analogue of the fundamental theorem of semi-Riemannian geometry.

Theorem 3.16. Let g, be a transverse semi-Riemannian metric on (M,F). There exists a unique transverse affine structure ▽| on (M,F) such that, for any ▽ ∈ ▽

- (i) the torsion tensor Tor(V) takes values in I'(TF), and
- (ii) Xg-(Y,Z) = g-(ÜxY,Z) + g-(Y, ÜxxZ), VX, Y, Z E X(M).
