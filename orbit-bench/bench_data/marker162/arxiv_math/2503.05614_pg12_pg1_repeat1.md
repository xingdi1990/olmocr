## 5.2 Arithmetic Duality and Functional Equations

The connection between the DACC framework and L-functions is further strengthened by the relationship between Poitou-Tate duality and the functional equation of L-functions.

Proposition 5.5 (Arithmetic Duality and Height Pairing). For an elliptic curve E/Q, the pairing induced by Poitou-Tate duality on the adelic complex coincides with the Néron-Tate height pairing on E(Q).

Proof Sketch. We outline this result in three steps:

Step 1: Establishing Derived Duality. For each local component, we prove:

RT(Qv, Do) ~ RHom(RI(Qv, Dv), Q/Z(1))[1]

For the global component:

RI global(E, D) ~ RHom(RI global(E, D), Q/Z(1)|1]

Using the mapping cone construction, we derive the duality for the adelic complex.

Step 2: Connection to Height Pairing. For P, Q E E(Q), we show that the pairing (P, Q) induced by duality equals the Néron-Tate height pairing h(P,Q) by analyzing local and global components.

For the archimedean component, we use the connection between periods and heights.

For non-archimedean components, we use the theory of local heights and their relation to Galois cohomology.

The global pairing emerges as the sum of these local contributions, matching the Néron-Tate height pairing.

Step 3: Determinant Interpretation. The determinant of this pairing on a basis of E(Q)/E(Q)fors gives the regulator RE, which explains its appearance in the formula for det(dr).

The proof establishes explicit isomorphisms in the derived category and verifies the duality relations at each place through detailed Galois cohomology calculations.

Theorem 5.6 (Arithmetic Duality). The adelic complex C\*(E) satisfies a derived version of Poitou-Tate duality:

This duality reflects the functional equation of the L-function:

$$
\Lambda(E, s) = \varepsilon\_E \cdot \Lambda(E, 2 - s)
$$

Proof. Step 1: Local and global duality.

For each local component, we establish:

RI (Q2), Dn) ~ RHom(RI(Qn, D2), Q/Z(1)|1]

This follows from local Tate duality in Galois cohomology.

For the global component:

$$R\Gamma\_{\text{global}}(E,\mathcal{D}) \simeq R\text{Hom}(R\Gamma\_{\text{global}}(E,\mathcal{D}), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$$
