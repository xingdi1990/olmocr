We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Let X C V(G) be a subset given by Lemma 2.4. We pass on to T = G(X]. The graph I has N ≥ an/128 vertices, and for ß = on/(8N) and d = t/4, the following holds:

- (i) I is a (ß, d)-expander, and
- (ii) for every partition V(T) = RU AU B with |R| < aN/16 and |A|, |B| ≥ ßN/4, there is an edge in I between A and B.

Let K = 25/a2 (the constant in the upper bound on the size of T in Lemma 3.3). Consider the family P of all ordered partitions V(T) = DU (US=1 W; ) UU, where k ≥ 0 (this can be a different number for different partitions), such that the following holds:

- (P1) For every i ∈ [k]: |W;| = √2KN ]= =: ℓ and Γ[W;] is connected,
- (P2) for every two distinct i, i' E [k], there is an edge in I between Wi and Wy, and
- (P3) |D| ≤ αN/(32d) and |Nr(D) ∩ U| < d|D|/2.

The first two properties imply that Kk is a minor of I.

By taking D = 0, k = 0 and U = V(Γ), we have that P is not empty. Consider a partition V(T) = DU (U ) UU in P which maximises |D |, tie-breaking by taking one which further maximises k. We prove that then necessarily

$$k \ge \frac{\alpha N}{64\ell} =: q.$$

As q = 0( / nt/ logn), this establishes the theorem. Suppose, towards a contradiction, that this is note the case. That is, k < q. Then

$$|W| = \left| \bigcup\_{i=1}^k W\_i \right| < \alpha N / 64,$$

from which we conclude |U ≥ N/2, with room to spare.

The property (P3) in the proof of Theorem 1.4 is identical to the one used here, and the only property of W used in the proof of Claim 3.1 and Claim 3.2 is the upper bound on W1, which is identical to the one used here. Therefore, same as in the proof of Theorem 1.4, the following holds:

- · For every i E [k] we have |Nr(Wi) U ≥ d|Wi[/2, and
- · Г[U] is a connected (ß/2,d/2)-expander.

Now we can finish the proof using Lemma 3.3. For each i ∈ [k], set Uz = Nr(Wi) n U. Then [U] ≥ dl/2 =: s. For k < i ≤ q, take Uz ≤ U to be an arbitrary set of size s. Apply Lemma 3.3 with sets U1, ... , Ug, which we indeed can do as qs > 2|U and |U/s > log|U|, where the former follows from d ≥ to(a)/4 and the latter follows from d ≤ √n. We obtain a subset T C U of size

$$|T| \le K \frac{|U|}{s} \log\left(\frac{qs}{|U|}\right) \cdot \frac{\log|U|}{\log d} \le \ell, \quad \ell$$
