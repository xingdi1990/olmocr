But the emptiness of the regions 7(3,2,k3) for k3 ≥ 3 follows from lemma 3(3c). Therefore,, A3(3, 1, 2) consists of the triples (23).

Further, if (k1, k2, k3) E A3(3, 1, 2), then we necessarily have (k1, k2) E A3(3, 1, 2). As it was stated before, we either have ki = 0 (mod 3), k2 = 1, or k1 = 3, k2 = 2.

For k2 = 1, the condition (19) corresponding to i = r = 3, reduces to

$$k\_1(k\_3 - 1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}.$$

Since k; = 0 (mod 3) in the first case, this condition can not be satisfied for any k;3. In the second case, the same condition takes the form

$$7k\_3 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}.$$

For k3 > 3, the emptiness of 7 (3, 2, k3) follows from lemma 3 (3c). Therefore, non-empty regions correspond to the values k3 = 1, k3 = 2 only. Hence, the set A5(3, 1, 2) consists of the triples

$$(3,2,1), \quad (3,2,2). \tag{24}$$

It turns out that for any r ≥ 4 the set A. (3, 1, 2) consists of two sets: (3, 2"-4, 1) and (3, 2"-1). Let us prove it by induction with respect to r.

For r = 3, it was proved earlier. Suppose now that this assertion holds for any r, 3 < r < m - 1, and check it for r = m.

Indeed, let (k1, ... , km) € Am(3, 1, 2). Then (k1, ... , hm=1) ∈ Am=1(3, 1, 2), so, by the induction, (ki, ... , km-1) is either (3, 2m-3, 1) or (3, 2m-2). Hence, (Ki1, ... , km) has the form (3, 2m-3, 1, k) or (3, 2m-2, k), where k ≥ 1 is some integer.

In the first case, the condition (19) corresponding to i = m, has the form

$$\mathbb{K}\_m(3, 2^{m-3}, 1, k) + \mathbb{K}\_{m-1}(2^{m-3}, 1, k) \not\equiv 2 \pmod{3}.\tag{25}$$

By explicit formulas for the continuants, we get

$$
\mathbb{K}\_m(3, 2^{m-3}, 1, k) = 2(k - m) + 3, \quad \mathbb{K}\_{m-1}(2^{m-3}, 1, k) = k - m + 2,
$$

so (25) has the form 3(k - m) + 5 ≠ 2 (mod 3). Therefore, it is not satisfied for any k. In the second case, we have the condition

$$
\mathbb{K}\_m(3, 2^{m-2}, k) + \mathbb{K}\_{m-1}(2^{m-2}, k) \not\equiv 2 \pmod{3}.
$$

Using the formulas

$$
\mathbb{K}\_m(3, 2^{m-2}, k) = 2km - k - 2m + 3, \quad \mathbb{K}\_m(2^{m-2}, k) = km - k - m + 2,
$$

we rewrite it as follows

3m(k - 1) - 2k + 5 ≠ 2 (mod 3), that is, k ≠ 0 (mod 3).

Now let us find all the tuples that contain the set A. (3, 1, 2) for r ≥ 4.
