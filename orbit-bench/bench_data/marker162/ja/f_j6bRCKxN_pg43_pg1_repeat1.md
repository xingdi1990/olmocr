# Directors' Report

## 30 June 2016

The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services, during the year, by the auditor (or by another person or firm on behalf of the auditor), is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.

On the advice of the audit committee, the Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the auditor, as set out above, did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the International Accounting and Ethics Standards Board (IASEB) for the following reasons:

- . all non-audit services have been reviewed by the audit committee to ensure that they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
- . none of the non-audit services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out by the IASEB.

### Auditors' Independence Declaration

The lead auditors' independence declaration for the year ended 30 June 2016 has been received and can be found on page 14 of the financial report.
