In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Independence In conducting our audit, we have complied with the applicable independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board. Auditor's Opinion In our opinion, the financial report of Astron Corporation Limited: presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated entity's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of their performance and cash flows for the year then ended; and

> b the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the IASB.
