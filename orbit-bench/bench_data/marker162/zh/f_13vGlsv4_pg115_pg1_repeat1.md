## 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

- (k) Impairment of assets (Continued)
	- (i) Impairment of investments in debt securities and receivables (Continued)

If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. A reversal of an impairment loss shall not result in the asset's carrying amount exceeding that which would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.

For available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in the fair value reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss.

> Impairment losses in respect of available-for-sale debt securities are reversed if the subsequent increase in fair value can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Reversals of impairment losses in such circumstances are recognised in profit or loss.
