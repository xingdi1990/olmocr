### 財務風險管理 35.

本集團金融工具於本集團業務一般過程中產生的主 要風險為信貸風險、流動資金風險、利率風險及貨 幣風險。

#### (a) 信貸風險

本集團的信貸風險主要來自資易及其他應收款 項及銀行存款。管理層已實行一項信貸政策, 並持續監控該等信貸風險。

就貿易及其他應收款項而言,對所有要求信貸 額超過若干金額的客戶,必須進行個別信貸評 估。此等信貸評估集中於客戶過往繳付到期款 項之歷史及現時付款之能力,以及考慮到客戶 之具體資料及客戶營運所在地之經濟環境。本 集團持續對貿易客戶的財務狀況進行信貸評 核。貿易應收款項自發票目期起計0至90日到 期。通常,本集團並不向客戶收取抵押品。

於報告期末,本集團存在一定的信貸集中風 險,因貿易及其他應收款項總額之20%(二零 一五年:16%)及44%(二零一五年:35%)分 別為應收自一名主要客戶及五大客戶。

管理層認為,於主要金融機構持有的大部分銀 行存款的信貸質素高。
