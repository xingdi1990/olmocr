# Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 財務報表附註(續)

(Expressed in Renminbi unless otherwise indicated) (除另行指明者外・以人民幣列示)

## 31 POSSIBLE IMPACT OF AMENDMENTS, NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

#### (Continued)

### IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers (Continued)

(b) Significant financing component (Continued)

> Currently, the Group would only apply such a policy when payments are significantly deferred, which is currently not common in the Group's arrangements with its customers. Currently, the Group does not apply such a policy when payments are received in advance.

> The Group is in the process of assessing whether this component in the Group's advance payment schemes would be significant to the contract and therefore whether, once IFRS 15 is adopted, the transaction price would need to be adjusted for the purposes of recognising revenue.

#### (c) Sales with a right of return

Currently when the customers are allowed to return the products, the Group estimates the level of returns and makes an adjustment against revenue and cost of sales.

The Group expects that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not materially affect how the Group recognises revenue and cost of sales when the customers have a right of return. However, the new requirement to recognise separately a return asset for the products expected to be returned will impact the presentation in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group currently adjusts the carrying amounts of inventory for the expected returns, instead of recognising a separate asset.

截至二零一六年十二月 क 三十一日止年度已頒佈惟 尚未生效的修訂、新訂準則及 詮釋的可能影響(續)

### 國際財務報告準則第15號,來自 客戶合約收益(續)

(b) 重大融資部分(續)

> 目前,本集團僅於付款大幅延期 時(目前本集團與其客戶間之安 排中並不常見)採納此政策。目 前,本集團並無於付款提前收取 時採納此政策。

> 本集團正在評估本集團提前付款 計劃中之該部分是否對合約而言 屬重大,及於國際財務報告準則 第15號採納後,交易價格是否將 因此須就確認收益而作出調整。

具退貨權之銷售 (c) 目前,當客戶被允許退回產品 時,本集團會估計退貨水平並就 收益及銷售成本作出調整。

> 本集團預期採納國際財務報告準 則第15號將不會對本集團於客戶 有退貨權時確認收益及銷售成本 之方式造成重大影響。然而,由 於本集團目前就預期退貨對存貨 賬面值進行調整而非另行確認資 產,因此另行就預期將被退回之 產品確認退回資產之新規定將影 響於綜合財務狀況表之呈列。
