### 18. GOODWILL (CONTINUED)

#### Mobile live broadcasting services

The recoverable amount of the CGU of the mobile live broadcasting business in PRC is determined by the value-in-use calculation. The calculation was carried out by cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year period. Cash flows for the five year period are estimated based on the management's expectation for the market in the first year and an average annual growth rate of turnover of 20% thereafter until year 5 and a pre-tax discount rate of 27%. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using an estimated weighted average growth rate of 3%. The estimated growth rates used are comparable to the growth rate for the industry.

The key assumption used in the value-in-use calculation is the average annual growth rate of turnover of the mobile live broadcasting business, which is determined based on the management's expectation for market development. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects specific risks relating to mobile live broadcasting segment. Any adverse change in the key assumptions could reduce the recoverable amount below carrying amount.

The management reassessed the recoverable amount of the CGU of mobile live broadcasting business in PRC as at 31 December 2016 by reference to the discounted cash flow calculation with the above estimation and was of the opinion that no impairment loss should be recognised as the recoverable amount of the CGU is higher than its carrying amount.
