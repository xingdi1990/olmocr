#### Impairment loss of financial assets (Continued)

For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment losses was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity investments will not be reversed in profit or loss in subsequent periods. Any increase in fair value subsequent to impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. For available-forsale debt investments, impairment losses are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the investment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.

### Financial liabilities and equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by a group entity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities. The Group's financial liabilities are generally classified as other financial liabilities.
