The rock pre-load activated the drainage wicks, forcing the water beneath the pit to travel to the surface where it was collected and pumped to the Tailings Storage Facility.

In 2016 work to cap the pre-load rock layer with an impervious layer of laterite was completed. ERA has sought permission from regulators to place the final bulk rock fill on top of the laterite layer in preparation for land forming and revegetation of the 39.3 hectare site.

# BRINE CONCENTRATOR

The Brine Concentrator treats process water which is stored in the Tailings Storage Facility and Pit 3.

Process water is heated to high temperatures and evaporated before being cooled, condensed and discharged to the environment as high quality, clean distilled water.

The Brine Concentrator produces high quality water suitable for release to ERA's constructed wetlands and then offsite, as well as concentrated brine.

During 2016 works to improve the reliability of the diesel power generators delivered an increased security of power supply to the Brine Concentrator resulting in more stable operations.

ERA continues to work with the Brine Concentrator equipment manufacturer HPD, a subsidiary of Veolia, to increase plant availability and address various technical issues. Significant improvement was made during the year to achieve improved availability and increase production rates of the Brine Concentrator.

During the year, the Brine Concentrator produced 1,306 megalitres of distillate and 95 megalitres of brine concentrate which was transferred to Pit 3 via the brine injection system.

## CLOSURE PLAN

ERA reviewed and updated the Ranger Closure Plan and submitted a draft for review by relevant stakeholders at the end of 2016

This Closure Plan includes a works programme that meets with the closure objectives as stated in the Ranger Authority and associated Environmental Requirements. The plan also includes proposed closure criteria for the Ranger mine which have been developed in consultation with the Supervising Scientist Branch, the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Resources, the Northern Land Council, the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation and the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Innovation and Science over several years.

The closure criteria address the key themes of closure which are landform, radiation, water, flora and fauna, soils and cultural.
