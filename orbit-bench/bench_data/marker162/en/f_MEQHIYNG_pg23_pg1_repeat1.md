# 7. Change in debt that does not benefit from the legal privilege

he asset surplus (assets exceeding obligations foncières and registered bonds) and miscellaneous needs are hanced by equity and debt that does not benefit from the privilege of the law on sociétés de crédit foncier.

Such financing is obtained through the parent company. At the end of December 2015, the funds borrowed from SFL within the framework of the financing agreement were made up of different loans with maturities that could initially run from one by to ten years with an Euribor or Eonia index.

Temporary financing may also be obtained from the Banque de France. These funds do not benefit from the privilege stipulated in the law on sociétés de crédit foncier, but they are guaranteed by loans and securities assigned for this purpose in the account of Caisse Française de Financement Local at the central bank. Caisse Francement Local had Nready used such financing in the past. Since the creation of SFIL, Caise Française de Financement Local has not cont hoted any loans from the Banque de France, except when it used small sums to test the access procedure for such funding. either did it contract any loans from credit institutions other than its parent company.

he change in financing that does not benefit from the legal privilege, excluding accrued interest not yet due, can be prented as follows.

| EUR billions     | 12/31/2014 | 12/31/2015 |

| OTAL             | 6.2        | 5.5        |
