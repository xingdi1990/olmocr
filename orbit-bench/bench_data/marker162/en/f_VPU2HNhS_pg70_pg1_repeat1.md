# ) ccounting policy: Employee benefits

## Short-term employee benefits

\ hort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised 1 br the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Long service leave

The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to xpected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.

Zxpected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Benefits falling more than 12 months after the end of the reporting beriod are classified as non-current.

#### Shared-based payment transactions

The Group currently engages in the practice of allocating its employees equity share-based payments s part of their remuneration packages.

he grant date fair value of share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is recognised ~ ; a share based payment expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the Ã©mployees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based c h the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the esting date.

For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the sharebased payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. The fair value of the equity instrument is calculated using the Black-Scholes or Binomial model.

#### Termination benefits ix

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating \ he employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of y jithdrawal or to providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary vedundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value and classified as non-current.
