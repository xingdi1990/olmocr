## Sensitivity

The analys's below shows the impact on the profit on a movement in foreign currency exchange rates against the Australian Dollar on the Group's major currencies using the net exposure at the balance date. A sensitivity of 10% is a reasonable measurement given the level of exchange rates and the volatility observed on a historic basis.

The impact on the profit or loss and equity is post-tax at a rate of 30%. The risks faced in the sensitivity analysis are the same as those applied in the comparative period. As shown below, a 10% movement in exchange rates would have a minimal impact on the Group's financial position:
