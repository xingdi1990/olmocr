The gain on acquisition represents the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over consideration paid represents a substantial discount to the book value of GSUSA's net assets at the GSUSA Closing Date, primarily due to the trade name, fixed assets, and right-of-use lease and liabilities compared to book value. The gain on aquisition was primarily the result of prior financial results, a lack of access to capital by the Seller, and the reflected the fact that GSUSA may need additional capital to fund operating losses.

The fair value of the identified intangible assets, including customer contracts and trade name were determined using the income-based approach. The fair value of curricula and licensing identified intangible assets were determined using the cost approach.
