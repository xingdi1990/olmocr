protection payment. Therefore, although it may be in our stockholders' best interests that we sell the contributed property, it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so because of these obligations or similar considerations. While we may be able to avoid these indemnification requirements by contributing such properties to an acquired subsidiary real estate investment trust (a "Subsidiary REIT") prior to any such sale, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so effectively.

## Tax protection agreements may require our Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business.

Under a tax protection agreement, our Operating may provide the contributor of property the opportunity to guarantee debt or enter into a deficit restoration obligation. If we fail to make such opportunities available, we may be required to deliver to such contributor a cash payment intended to approximate the contributor's tax liability resulting from our failure to make such opportunities available to that contributor and the tax liabilities incurred as a result of such tax protection payment. These obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business.

## Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating may delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited acquisition of us or a change of our control.

Provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating may delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited acquisition of us or a change of our control. These provisions include, among others:

- · redemption rights of qualifying parties;
- a requirement that we may not be removed as the general partnership without our consent:
- · transfer restrictions on our OP Units;
- our ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners; . and
- · the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest and mergers under specified circumstances.

These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or a change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. Our chartership agreement of the Operating Partnership and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of us that might involve a premium price for that our stockholders otherwise might believe to be in their best interests.

## Our UPREIT structure may result in potential conflicts of interest with limited partners in the Operating whose interests may not be aligned with those of our stockholders.

Limited partners in the Operating Partnership have the right to vote on certain amended and restated limited operating partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership Agreement," as well as on certain other matters. Persons holding such voting rights may exercise them in a manner that conflicts with our stockholders' interests. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the ther hand. Our directors and officers have duties to our company and our stockholders under Maryland law in connection with their management of our company.

## We may acquire co-ownership interests in property that are subject to certain co-ownership agreements which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, relative to if the co-ownership aqreements did not exist.

We may acquire co-ownership interests, especially in connection with the Operating potential private placements, such as tenancy-in-common interests in property, interests in DSTs that own property and/or similar interests, which are subject to certain co-ownership agreements. The co-ownership agreements may limit our ability to encumber, lease, or dispose of our co-ownership interest.
