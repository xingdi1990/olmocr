## The banking industry is heavily regulation, together with any future legislation or regulatory changes, could limit or restrict our activities and adverselv affect our operations or financial results.

We operate in an extensively requlated industry and we are subject to examination, and comprehensive requiration by various federal and state agencies. The Company is subject to Federal Reserve regulations, and the Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and the NYDFS. Our compliance with banking regulations is costly and restrities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization quidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our business.

Furthermore, our regulators also have the ability to compel us to take certain actions, or restrict us from taking entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to consitive an unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies (such as a memorandum of understanding, a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order), civil money to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank experiences financial distress.

A capital injection may be required at times when we the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy trustee will assume any commiment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the holding company's general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
