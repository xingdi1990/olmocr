At December 31, 2023, we had three CRE whole loans, with total amorized costs of \$41,2 million, and one mezzanine loan, with a total amortized cost of \$4.7 million, in payment default. At December 31, 2022, we had three CRE whole loans, with total amortized ossts of \$51.6 million, in payment default.

## Modifications

We are required to disclose modifications where we determined the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and modified the agreement to: (i) forgive principal, (ii) reduce the interest rate, (iii) cause an other-than-insignificant payment deloan term or (v) any combination thereof.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into one CRE whole loan modification that: (i) extended the maturity from December 2025, (ii) reduced its interest rate from BR+500 to BR+250, and (iii) modified its payment terms and will acrue to the lesser of net operating cash flow or BR+250. Any unpaid interest will be due at loan payoff. At December 31, 2023, this loan had an amortized cost of \$44.9 million, which represented 2.4% of the total amortized cost of the portfolio.

During the vear ended December 31, 2022, we entered into three agreements that extended one CRE whole loan for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. At December 31, 2022, this loan had an amortized cost of \$20.7 million, which represented 1.0% of the total amortized cost of the portfolio. At December 31, 2023, this loan was in payment default.

## Restricted Cash

At December 31, 2023, we had restricted cash of \$8.4 million held in reserve for a construction loan and \$800,000 held in escrow for deposits or tax payments at our real estate properties or pledged with minimum reserve balance requirements. At December 31, 2022, we had restricted cash of \$38,6 million held within our five consolidated securitization entities and \$400,000 held in escrow for deposits or tax payments at our real estate properties or pledged with minimum reserve balance requirements.

The decrease of \$30.2 million was primarily attributable to reinvesting the proceeds in two of our securitizations prior to the end of their reinvestment periods partially offset by the reserve held for a construction loan on one of our real estate investments.
