## 12. GOING CONCERN BASIS

To comply with the directives of the Reserve Bank of India the company ceased to accept deposits from September 1997. Despite cessation of business, substantial accumulated losses, non-provision for full NPA's and interest payable, rejection of the "old scheme under review" and winding up petition filed by the Reserve Bank of India and various creditors of the company, the accounts of the company have been prepared on a "going concern" basis on an assumption made by the management that adequate finances and opportunities would be available in the foreseeable future to enable the company to start operating on a profitable basis.
