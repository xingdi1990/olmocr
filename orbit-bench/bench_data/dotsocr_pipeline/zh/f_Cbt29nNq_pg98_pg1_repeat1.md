The Law suit came about because there was a possible share transaction which eventually fell through. It has always been the view of the Company's legal representative that the Plaintiff's claim is totally without ground. The Company had taken legal advice and has already given instructions to their legal representative to make an application to strike out the claim with costs, for (1) lack of merits of the claim, and (2) want of prosecution.
