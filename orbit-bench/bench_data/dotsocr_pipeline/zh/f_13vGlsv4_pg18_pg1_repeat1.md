We believe the consignment model allows more efficient inventory flow among retail outlets in different markets by saving the lead time for inventory distribution among distributors in different locations, enabling the Group to have more control over the inventory mix to be produced and displayed in retail outlets, and hence shorten the time between product development, production planning and delivery of products to the points of sales. The Group believes these benefits will improve our supply chain efficiency, the inventory turnover and sell-through rate at distribution channel and in turn improve the Group's revenue, profits and sustain growth. We believe this could attract more distributors to join us for expanding our retail network in local markets as well."}, {"bbox": [819, 1217, 1093, 1251], "category": "Section-header", "text": "### 部分轉型為代銷模式"}, {"bbox": [818, 1299, 1330, 1719], "category": "Text", "text": "我們正逐步將以批發模式經營的零售店舖向代銷模式轉型。我們相信代銷模式透過節省分銷商於不同市場地點的存貨分配的交付時間,更有效地促進不同市場零售店舖間的存貨流動,有助於本集團更好地掌控產品結構及於零售店舖展示的存貨組合,進而縮短產品開發、產品設計與向零售點交付產品之間的時間。本集團認為該等優勢將會提升我們的供應鏈效率、改善分銷渠道的存貨周轉率及售罄率,進一步提升本集團的收益、溢利及持續增長能力。我們相信,這亦可吸引更多分銷商加盟以擴大我們於本地市場的零售網絡。"}, {"bbox": [235, 1979, 690, 2004], "category": "Page-footer", "text": "16 Cabbeen Fashion Limited • Annual Report 2016"}]
