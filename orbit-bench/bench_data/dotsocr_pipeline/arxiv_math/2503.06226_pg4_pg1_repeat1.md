(2023); Gao et al. (2016); Lewis & Vamvoudakis (2011); Rizvi & Lin (2019, 2020, 2023). Particularly, it is proven in Rizvi & Lin (2023) that the requirement on the full row rank of $\\bar{W}$ is necessary to guarantee the convergence performance of the aforementioned ADP-based output feedback learning approaches, so is the same requirement on $\\bar{M}$ along the similar proof. However, as we can see from (8), under Assumption 1, the parameterization matrix $\\bar{M}$ may not be of full row rank when the system matrix A has the eigenvalue 0. It follows from Rizvi & Lin (2023, Theorem 4) that the parameterization matrix $\\bar{W}$ may not be of full row rank when the matrices $(A-LC)$ and A have common eigenvalues. On the other hand, as stated in Postoyan et al. (2016), the stability of the closed-loop system under the learning control approach proposed in Lewis & Vamvoudakis (2011) cannot be guaranteed. Although this issue was eliminated in Chen et al. (2023); Rizvi & Lin (2019, 2023), the requirement of the convergence of state observer is needed to ensure the equivalence of the dynamic output feedback controller with the state feedback controller. This implies that the observer error will influence the convergence and optimality performance of the ADP-based output feedback learning control approaches in Chen et al.
