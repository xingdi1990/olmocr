First, the proposed two-step framework could be directly extended to the antenna selection problem with discrete positions, regardless of whether the exact antennas deployment [38]â€“[41]. The group-sparse recovery formulation and D-GRIP analysis can be directly adapted to delay-Doppler domain channel estimation [42], [43], where structures induce similar group-wise sparsity patterns in reconstruction. The DC-GOMP algorithm employs a correlation-aware selection mechanism to dynamically resolve coherence conflicts, offering a systematic and efficient approach to sparse event detection. Then, MILP-based spatial equalization offers new insights for the resource-constrained optimization in RIS configuration on discrete phase [44]. These potential extensions highlight that our methodology effectively tackles the unified challenge of sparsity-aware optimization under structured constraints, making it applicable to a wide range of domains, including computational sensing, adaptive control, and beyond."}, {"bbox": [902, 956, 1175, 988], "category": "Section-header", "text": "V.
