(It is easy to see that the argument for single-sorted algebras lifts to the many-sorted case; at any rate, cf. [25, Proposition 4.8]). We now prove that $\\neg(4) \\implies \\neg(3)$ Up to passing to coordinates, we can assume that the clone $\\mathbf{T}$ is the partition-of-unity clone of a Boolean algebra $\\mathbf{B}$. Let $a := (b_1, \\dots, b_n) \\in T(n)$, with $a$ different from $e_1^n, \\dots, e_n^n$. This implies that there exists $i$ such that $b_i \\notin \\{0,1\\}$. Letting $c := b_i$, and consequently having $\\neg c = \\bigvee\\{a_k : k \\neq i\\}$, it is a standard fact regarding Boolean algebras that $\\mathbf{B} \\simeq \\mathbf{B}/\\theta(c, 1) \\times \\mathbf{B}/\\theta(c, 0)$, where $\\theta(c, 1)$ (resp. $\\theta(c, 0)$) is the smallest congruence identifying $c$ and 1 (resp. $c$ and 0). To conclude the argument, observe that if $(b_1, \\dots, b_n) \\in T(n)$, then, $(b_1, \\dots, b_n, 0, \\dots, 0) \\in T(m)$ for all $m > n$. Therefore, for each $n$ we have a decomposition of $T(n)$ in (at least) two factors and $\\mathbf{T}$ is not directly indecomposable.
