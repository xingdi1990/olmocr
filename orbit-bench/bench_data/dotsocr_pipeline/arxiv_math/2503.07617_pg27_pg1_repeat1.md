Since concentration transport is driven by the Darcy velocity, we assume that there are some uncertainties in the process of solving the Darcyâ€™s flow system to increase the complexity of state estimation. Thus, we add a small perturbation $\\xi_{\\text{Darcy}} = 0.0001\\epsilon_D$ to the reference Darcy velocities with $\\epsilon_{\\text{Darcy}} \\sim N(0, I)$ and input the disturbed velocity to the forward solver. The reference Darcy velocity field and one example of the perturbed velocity field are shown in Figure 29 on a very coarse mesh for the purpose of illustration. We can see that even with a small amount of noise, the perturbed Darcy field is significantly chaotic, which makes the task of state estimation challenging."}, {"bbox": [170, 1263, 1285, 1462], "category": "Text", "text": "Similar to Test Case 2, we aim to investigate the performance of the United Filter under various levels of perturbation.
