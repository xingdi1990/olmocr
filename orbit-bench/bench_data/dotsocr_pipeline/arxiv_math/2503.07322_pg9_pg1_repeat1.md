However, for $d \\ge 5$ the free resolution of the kernel of $H^*(\\mathrm{BSO}(d)) \\to H^*(F_d//\\mathrm{SO}(d))$, i.e. the ideal generated by monomials in the Pontrjagin classes of degree $> 2d$, has higher syzygies and the proof for $d=3$ does not generalize to show that $D^1(V_2) \\subset B_{d+1} \\otimes V_2$. In fact, one would need to show a stronger version of Corollary 2.19 to get a splitting of (2.21) for odd $d > 3$. Nonetheless, it follows from Nariman's results that the monomials in the Euler and Pontrjagin classes do not vanish and I expect that one can improve the statement of Corollary 2.19 or control the image of the connecting homomorphism of (2.21) in order to find a purely algebraic proof of Nariman's result. For this reason, I have kept a general version of Corollary 2.19 in this article in the hope that it can serve as a starting point to prove a more general version of Theorem 2.20 â€“ it is hard to imagine that the statement doesn't generalize to all odd $d$."}]
