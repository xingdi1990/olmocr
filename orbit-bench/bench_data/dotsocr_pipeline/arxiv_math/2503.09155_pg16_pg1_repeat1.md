He noted that if $e$ is locally asymptotically stable, then one may expect that all solutions converge to $e$, and proved that system (29) admits a periodic solution whenever $e$ is unstable. For $n = 3$, the model can also be studied using the theory of competitive dynamical systems (Smith, 1995). The case $n = 3$ has also been analyzed using the theory of Hopf bifurcations (Woller et al., 2014). For a general $n$, the analysis using Hopf bifurcations becomes highly non-trivial and results exist only for special cases, e. g. under the additional assumption that all the $\\alpha_i$'s are equal, see Invernizzi and Treu (1991). Hastings et al.
