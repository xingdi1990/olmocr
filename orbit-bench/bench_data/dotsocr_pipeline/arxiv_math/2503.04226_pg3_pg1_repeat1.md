Their characterization of stable Farkas' lemma consisted in the closedness of certain cone associated with the given conic system. After the introduction of the concept of closedness regarding a given set by Bo≈£ in 2010, successive characterizations of (stable) Farkas' lemma in terms of closedness of certain set regarding another set were obtained for different types of systems, e.g., systems involving convex, nonconvex composite functions [8], [9], [10], systems involving vector-valued functions ([4] and [6]), systems involving a family of finite subsets of the given index set [7], etc. The characterization of stable Farkas' lemma for nonconvex composite semi-infinite programming has been considered in [16] and [17]."}, {"bbox": [241, 734, 1153, 1260], "category": "Text", "text": "Considering feasible sets of the form $C \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{-1}(D)$, with the convex set $D$ not being necessarily a cone, is the main novelty of this paper, which is organized as follows.

Section 4 is devoted to linear infinite systems. Section 5 characterizes Farkas-type lemmas oriented to identify the minima of convex (resp. concave) functions on $C \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{-1}(D)$, reason why they are known in the literature as convex (resp. concave) Farkas' lemmas. More in detail, the convex Farkas' lemmas provided in Section 3 determine when a convex feasible set of the form $C \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{-1}(D)$ is contained in the reverse-convex set $\\{x \\in X : f(x) \\ge 0\\}$, where $f$ is convex. Similarly, Section 5 characterizes the containment of $C \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{-1}(D)$ in the sublevel set of a convex function $f$ (Theorem 23). Finally, Section 6 shows applications to constrained convex minimization problems (optimization, strong duality and stable strong duality theorems) and to functional approximation by polynomials (Farkas-type lemmas)."}, {"bbox": [241, 1337, 895, 1373], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## 2 Primal closedness characterizations"}, {"bbox": [241, 1386, 1153, 1455], "category": "Text", "text": "Recall that $f: X \\to \\bar{\\mathbb{R}}$ ($f \\in \\bar{\\mathbb{R}}^X$ in short) is a proper convex function.
