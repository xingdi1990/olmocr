Note that $F_*$ maps $\\mathcal{F}^M$-vertical vectors into $\\mathcal{F}^N$-vertical vectors, but not necessarily surjectively. It will become clear that it is necessary that only $\\mathcal{F}^M$-vertical vectors are mapped into $\\mathcal{F}^N$-vertical vectors. For example, consider $id: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$, where the first $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is foliated by $T\\mathcal{F}^1 = \\mathbb{R}_{\\overline{\\partial}}$ and the second one is foliated by $T\\mathcal{F}^2 = \\mathbb{R}_{\\overline{\\partial}} \\oplus \\mathbb{R}_{\\overline{\\partial}}$. It is clear that $id$ is a foliated diffeomorphism. The usual flat connection $\\nabla^{\\text{flat}}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a transverse affine connection to both foliations, albeit associated with different partner connections $\\omega^1$ and $\\omega^2$ (each of them is just $\\nabla^{\\text{flat}}$ restricted to the respective vertical distributions).
