It is worth noting that a similar analysis in the case of non local functionals of convolution type has been performed in a recent paper by R. Alicandro, M.S. Gelli and C. Leone [4]. From a technical point of view we mainly adopt the strategy exploited in [4], which in turn is inspired by [5]. The idea is to use a separation-of-scales argument, formalized in [5] and then deal with the non locality of our functionals to estimate the contribution near the perforations. A crucial role is played by a discrete version of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, which is derived from the corresponding non local variant proved in [4]. This inequality allows us to show the convergence of minimum problems on unbounded domains, defining the approximating capacitary densities, to the limit energy density defined in (3.13)."}, {"bbox": [213, 585, 1241, 733], "category": "Text", "text": "The paper is organized as follows.
