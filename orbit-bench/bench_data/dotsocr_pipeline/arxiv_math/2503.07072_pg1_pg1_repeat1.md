This is a variant of Turán's classical extremal problem. We show lower and upper bounds for the maximum number of $s$-cliques in a graph with no disjoint copies of arbitrary graph. We also determine the maximum number of $s$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain a disjoint union of $k$ paths of length two when $k = 2, 3$, or $s \\ge k + 2$, or $n$ is sufficiently large, this partly confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang [1]."}, {"bbox": [237, 953, 479, 986], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## 1.

The classical extremal function $\\text{ex}(n, H)$ denoted as $\\text{ex}(n, H)$, is formally defined as the maximum number of edges on an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph. This function extends naturally to a scenario where the objective is not merely to maximize the number of edges, but rather to maximize the number of copies of a specified graph $T$ within an $n$-vertex graph that is $H$-free. In accordance with the notation introduced by Alon and Shikhelman [2], the more general function is denoted as $\\text{ex}(n, T, H)$, which is commonly referred to the generalized Turán number of $H$. Let $P_k$ be the path with $k$ vertices. Obviously, $\\text{ex}(n, P_2, H) = \\text{ex}(n, H)$. We denote the cycle with $\\ell$ vertices by $C_\\ell$ and the complete graph with $s$ vertices by $K_s$."}, {"bbox": [235, 1386, 1350, 1644], "category": "Text", "text": "The exploration of such problems dates back to the foundational work of Erdős [3], who established the values of $\\text{ex}(n, K_s, K_t)$ for any two cliques.
