For any graph $H$, let $V(H)$ denote the vertex set of $H$ and let $E(H)$ denote the edge set of $H$. We say $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, denoted by $H \\subset G$, if $V(H) \\subset V(G)$ and $E(H) \\subset E(G)$. We say $\\varphi: V(H) \\to V(S)$ is an injection, if for all $(i, j) \\in E(H)$ we have $(\\varphi(i), \\varphi(j)) \\in E(S)$. For $H, S \\subset \\mathcal{K}_n$, denote by $H \\cap S$ the graph with vertex set given by $V(H) \\cap V(S)$ and edge set given by $E(H) \\cap E(S)$, and denote by $S \\cup H$ the graph with vertex set given by $V(H) \\cup V(S)$ and edge set given by $E(H) \\cup E(S)$. For any graph $H$, denote the excess of $H$ by $\\tau(H) = |E(H)| - |V(H)|$. Given $u \\in V(H)$, define $\\text{Nei}_H(u)$ to be the set of neighbors of $u$ in $H$. For two vertices $u, v \\in V(H)$, we define $\\text{Dist}_H(u, v)$ to be their graph distance. Denote the diameter of a connected graph $H$ by $\\text{Diam}(H) = \\max_{u,v \\in V(H)} \\text{Dist}_H(u, v)$.\n*   **Graph isomorphisms and unlabeled graphs.** Two graphs $H$ and $H'$ are isomorphic, denoted by $H \\cong H'$, if there exists a bijection $\\pi: V(H) \\to V(H')$ such that $(\\pi(u), \\pi(v)) \\in E(H')$ if and only if $(u, v) \\in E(H)$. Denote by $\\mathcal{H}$ the isomorphism class of graphs; it is customary to refer to these isomorphic classes as unlabeled graphs. Let $\\text{Aut}(H)$ be the number of automorphisms of $H$ (graph isomorphisms to itself). For any graph $H$, define $\\text{Fix}(H) = \\{u \\in V(H) : \\varphi(u) = u, \\forall \\varphi \\in \\text{Aut}(H)\\}$.\n*   **Induced subgraphs.** For a graph $H = (V, E)$ and a subset $A \\subset V$, define $H_A = (A, E_A)$ to be the induced subgraph of $H$ in $A$, where $E_A = \\{(u, v) \\in E : u, v \\in A\\}$. Also, define $H_{\\setminus A} = (V, E_{\\setminus A})$ to be the subgraph of $H$ obtained by deleting all edges with both endpoints in $A$. Note that $E_A \\cup E_{\\setminus A} = E$.\n*   **Isolated vertices.** For $u \\in V(H)$, we say $u$ is an isolated vertex of $H$ if there is no edge in $E(H)$ incident to $u$. Denote $\\mathcal{I}(H)$ as the set of isolated vertices of $H$.\n*   **Paths, self-avoiding paths and non-backtracking paths.** We say a subgraph $H \\subset \\mathcal{K}_n$ is a path with endpoints $u, v$ (possibly with $u = v$), if there exist $w_1, \\dots, w_m \\in [n] \\neq u, v$ such that $V(H) = \\{u, v, w_1, \\dots, w_m\\}$ and $E(H) = \\{(u, w_1), (w_1, w_2), \\dots, (w_m, v)\\}$ (we allow the occurrence of multiple vertices or edges). We say $H$ is a self-avoiding path if $w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_m, w_{m+1}$ are distinct (where we denote $w_0 = u$ and $w_{m+1} = v$), and we say $H$ is a non-backtracking path if $w_{i+1} \\neq w_{i-1}$ for $1 \\le i \\le m$. Denote $\\text{EndP}(P)$ as the set of endpoints of a path $P$.\n*   **Cycles and independent cycles.** We say a subgraph $H$ is an $m$-cycle if $V(H) = \\{v_1, \\dots, v_m\\}$ and $E(H) = \\{(v_1, v_2), \\dots, (v_{m-1}, v_m), (v_m, v_1)\\}$. For a subgraph $K \\subset H$, we say $K$ is an independent $m$-cycle of $H$, if $K$ is an $m$-cycle and no edge in $E(H) \\setminus E(K)$ is incident to $V(K)$. Denote $\\mathcal{C}_m(H)$ as the set of independent $m$-cycles of $H$. For $H \\subset S$, we define $\\mathfrak{C}_m(S, H)$ to be the set of independent $m$-cycles in $S$ whose vertex set is disjoint from $V(H)$.\n*   **Leaves.** A vertex $u \\in V(H)$ is called a leaf of $H$, if the degree of $u$ in $H$ is 1; denote $\\mathcal{L}(H)$ as the set of leaves of $H$.\n*   **Trees and rooted trees.** We say a graph $T = (V(T), E(T))$ is a tree, if $T$ is connected and has no cycles. We say a pair $(T, \\mathfrak{R}(T))$ is a rooted tree with root $\\mathfrak{R}(T)$, if $T$ is a tree and $\\mathfrak{R}(T) \\in V(T)$. For a rooted tree $T$ and $u \\in V(T)$, we define $\\text{Dep}_T(u) = \\text{Dist}_T(\\mathfrak{R}(T), u)$ to be"}]
