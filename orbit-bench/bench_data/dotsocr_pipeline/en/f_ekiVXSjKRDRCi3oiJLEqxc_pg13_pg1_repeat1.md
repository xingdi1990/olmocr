This is a significant achievement as approximately 90% of Buckreef Gold's gold mineral resource is held in sulphide (fresh) material, thus unlocking significant economic potential for the future of the project. This bulk sample test indicates that the Company can likely process sulphide ore through its existing processing plant, which has the potential to greatly minimize capex for future plant expansions."}, {"bbox": [778, 320, 1426, 837], "category": "Picture"}, {"bbox": [83, 1020, 693, 1056], "category": "Section-header", "text": "## EXCITING RESULTS FROM THE DRILL BIT"}, {"bbox": [83, 1096, 725, 1556], "category": "Text", "text": "The Buckreef Gold land package is vast, with much blue-sky potential built-in. During the year, the Company drilled 11,171 meters of exploration, infill and sterilization drilling. Buckreef Gold announced positive near surface drill results from the high-priority Anfield and Eastern Porphyry Zones, which are parallel and in close proximity to the Buckreef Main Zone and represent an important opportunity to host future mineral resources. Buckreef Gold also announced an extension of the Buckreef Main Zone South by an additional 200 meters, increasing the strike length of the Buckreef Main Zone deposit, or known gold mineralization, to over 2.0 kilometers in strike length."}, {"bbox": [778, 1019, 1426, 1816], "category": "Picture"}]
