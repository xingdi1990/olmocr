Uncertainties resulting from our participation in intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or interim proceedings or developments that could be perceived negatively by analysts or investors and the value of such intellectual property could be diminished.
