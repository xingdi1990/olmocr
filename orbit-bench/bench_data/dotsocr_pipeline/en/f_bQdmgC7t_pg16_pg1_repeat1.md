This ASU also requires companies to classify cash flows resulting from employee share-based payments, including the additional tax benefits or expenses related to the vesting or settlement of share-based awards, as cash flows from operating activities rather than financing activities. Although this change will reduce some of the administrative complexities of tracking share-based awards, it will increase the volatility of our income tax expense and cash flows from operations. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this ASU during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and are therefore required to report the impacts as though the ASU had been adopted on July 1, 2015, the beginning of our fiscal year, and to reflect the tax benefit as a discrete item within each of the respective interim reporting periods. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to earnings of $11.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2016 and we also recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to operating cash flows of $14.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The new accounting standard did not impact any periods prior to July 1, 2015, as we applied the changes on a prospective basis."}, {"bbox": [90, 759, 348, 787], "category": "Section-header", "text": "#### (4) Earnings Per Share"}, {"bbox": [141, 809, 1491, 923], "category": "Text", "text": "We compute basic earnings per share by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
