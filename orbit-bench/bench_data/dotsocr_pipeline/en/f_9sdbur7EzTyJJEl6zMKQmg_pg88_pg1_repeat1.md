A contract is created with the customer at the time the order is placed by the customer, which creates a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue for its single performance obligation at the time control of the product passes to the customer, which is when the goods are transferred to a third-party common carrier, for purchases through the Company's online websites, or at point of sale, for purchases in its stores.
