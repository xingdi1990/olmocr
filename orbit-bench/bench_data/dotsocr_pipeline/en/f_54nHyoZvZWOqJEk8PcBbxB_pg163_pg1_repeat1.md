The net impact of these changes were offset by changes to Brookfield Renewable's long-term energy revenue agreement with Brookfield associated with several entities owned by Brookfield Renewable in the United States, however the changes resulted in a difference in timing of cash flows. As a result, the amendments were accounted for in reflection of their substance, with the recognition of contract asset and liability balances and net financing charges to be recognized over the remainder of the term of the agreements. There are no material provisions for expected credit losses on contract assets. See Note 28 â€“ Related party transactions, for additional details regarding Brookfield Renewable's revenue agreements with Brookfield."}]
