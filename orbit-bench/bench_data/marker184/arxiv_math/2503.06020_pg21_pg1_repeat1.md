## 3.3. Global existence.

**Theorem 3.10.** Assuming that  $(3.2)$  and  $(3.3)$  are satisfied, then the conclusions in Theorem 3.4 hold for any  $T > 0$ .

*Proof.* By Theorem 3.4, we may assume that (3.1) has a unique solution  $(u, g, h)$  defined on some maximal time interval  $(0, T_m)$  with  $T_m \in (0, \infty]$ , and

$$h, g \in C^{1+\frac{\beta}{2}}((0, T_m)), \quad u \in C^{1+\frac{\beta}{2}, 2+\beta}(\Omega_{T_m}),$$

where  $\n\Omega_{T_m} := \{(t, x) : t \in (0, T_m), x \in [g(t), h(t)]\}.\n$  To complete the proof, we must demonstrate that  $T_m = \infty$ . Suppose  $T_m < \infty$ . Then, by the proof of Theorem 3.4, along with Lemmas 3.8 and 3.9, there exist positive constants

$$0 \le u(x,t) \le C_1, \quad |h'(t)| + |g'(t)| \le C_2, \quad |h(t)|, |g(t)| \le C_2t + h_0.$$

For any small constant  $\varepsilon > 0$ , it follows from the proof of Theorem 3.4 and Lemmas 3.8 and 3.9 that  $u, v \in C^{1+\beta, \frac{1+\beta}{2}}(\Omega_{T_m-\varepsilon})$ . Thus, as in Step 4 of the proof of Theorem 3.4, applying Schauder's estimates, for any fixed  $0 < T_0^* < T_m - \varepsilon$ , we obtain  $||u||_{C^{2+\beta,1+\frac{\beta}{2}}(\Omega_{T_m-\varepsilon}\setminus\Omega_{T_0})} \leq Q^*$ , where  $Q^*$  depends on  $T_0, T_m$ , and  $C_i$  for  $i = 1, 2$ , but is independent of  $\varepsilon$ . Since  $\varepsilon > 0$  can be made arbitrarily small, it follows that for any  $t \in [T_0, T_m)$ ,

$$\|u(t,\cdot)\|_{C^{2+\beta}([g(t),h(t)])} \le Q^*.$$

By repeating the arguments used in the proof of Theorem 3.4, we can conclude that there exists  $T>0$  small, depending on  $Q^*$  and  $C_i$   $(i=1,2)$ , such that the solution to (3.1) with initial time  $T_m-\frac{T}{2}$ can be extended uniquely to  $t = T_m - \frac{T}{2} + T > T_m$ , a contradiction to the definition that  $T_m$  is the maximal time interval for the solution. Thus, we must have  $T_m = \infty$ .

3.4. **Proof of Theorem 3.1.** Let us first note that  $f(t,x,1) \equiv 0$  and  $f(t,x,u) \leq \bar{f}(u) < 0$  for  $u > 1$ imply  $\bar{f}(1) = 0$ . Let  $M_0 = \max\{\|u_0\|_{\infty}, 1\}$  and  $v(t)$  be the solution of

$$v' = f(v), \ v(0) = M_0.$$

Since  $\bar{f}(v) < 0$  for  $v > 1$ , we clearly have  $1 \le v(t) \le M_0$  and  $v(t) \to 1$  as  $t \to \infty$ . Since  $f(t, x, u) \le \bar{f}(u)$ for  $u \geq 1$ , we obtain

$$v_t - dv_{xx} = f(v) \ge f(t, x, v)$$
 for  $t > 0, x \in [g(t), h(t)].$ 

We also have  $v \ge 1 > \delta = u$  for  $x \in \{g(t), h(t)\}$  and  $v(0) = M_0 \ge u(0, x)$  for  $x \in [-h_0, h_0]$ . Therefore the standard comparison principle over the region  $\{(t,x): t>0, x\in [g(t),h(t)]\}$  infers  $u(t,x)\leq v(t)$  in this region. It follows that

(3.31) 
$$\limsup_{t \to \infty} u(t, x) \le \limsup_{t \to \infty} v(t) = 1 \text{ uniformly for } x \in [g(t), h(t)].$$

To bound  $u(t,x)$  from below, we first make use of (3.4) to show that there exists  $T_0 > 0$  such that  $(3.32)$  $u(t,x) \ge \delta$  for  $t \ge T_0$  and  $x \in [g(t), h(t)].$ 

Similar to the proof of Theorem 1.1, since  $f$  satisfies  $(f_A)$ , we are able to choose a function  $\hat{f} \in C^1$ sufficiently close to  $f$  in  $L^{\infty}$  such that  $\hat{f}(s) \leq f(s)$  for  $s \geq 0$ , and  $\hat{f}$  satisfies  $(\mathbf{F}_{\mathbf{b}})$  with  $(P,Q) = (\hat{\theta}, \delta)$ for some  $\hat{\theta} \in [\theta, \delta) \cap (0, \delta)$ . Then, by Lemma 2.1, the traveling wave problem (2.4) has a solution pair  $(c,q) = (c_0,q_0)$  with  $c_0 > 0$  and  $q_0(\cdot)$  strictly increasing.

The same reasoning as in the proof of Theorem 1.1 shows that for some  $L > 0$  sufficiently large,

$$\underline{u}(t,x) := \max\{q_0(ct-x-L), q_0(ct+x-L)\}\$$

satisfies (in the weak sense)

$$\underline{u}_t \le d\underline{u}_{xx} + \underline{f}(\underline{u}) \le f(t, x, \underline{u}) \quad \text{for } t > 0, \ x \in \mathbb{R}$$

Additionally,

$$0 \le \underline{u}(t,x) \le \delta \le u(t,x) \text{ for } t > 0, \ x \in \{g(t), h(t)\},\$$

and

 $\underline{u}(0,x) \leq u_0(x) \quad \text{for } x \in [-h_0, h_0].$ 

Therefore we can apply the standard comparison principle over  $\{(t,x): t>0, x\in [g(t), h(t)]\}$  to deduce  $u(t,x) \geq \underline{u}(t,x)$  in this region.

Moreover, using

$$\lim_{t \to \infty} \|\underline{u}(t, \cdot) - \delta\|_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})} = 0,$$
