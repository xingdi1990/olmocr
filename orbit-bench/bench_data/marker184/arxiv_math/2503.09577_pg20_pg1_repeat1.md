with global minima at index  $i_0$  there are exactly  $\sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} (k-1)k^{i-1}$  descents by Theorem 5.3. The number of inversions can be expressed through the values of the permutation before the minimum:  $I(k,n,w) = \frac{k^n(k-1)}{4} \sum_{i=1}^n (k^{n-i} - k^{n-i-(c_w)_i}) = \frac{k^n(k-1)}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} (k^{n-i} - k^{n-i-w_i+1}).$ 

Now, we describe some bounds on the number of descents and inversion in the stable configuration depending on the permutation. We start with permutations with an increasing tail.

**Proposition 6.1.** Given permutation w, if there exists an  $i_0 \in \mathbb{N}$  such that for all indices  $i \geq i_0$ , we have  $w_i < w_{i+1}$ , then  $C_{k,n,w}$  has at most  $\sum_{j=1}^{i_0-1} (k-1)k^{j-1}$  descents and at most  $\binom{k}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} k^{i-1} \binom{k^{n-i}}{2}$ inversions.

*Proof.* Because  $w_i < w_{i+1}$  for all integers i such that  $i \geq i_0$ , we find that  $(c_w)_i = 0$  for all  $i \geq i_0$ . Therefore, the support of  $c_w$  is a subset of  $[i_0 - 1]$ . Thus, by Theorem 5.3, we have that there are at most  $\sum_{j=1}^{i_0-1} (k-1)k^{j-1}$  descents in  $C_{k,n,w}$ .

Because  $(c_w)_i = 0$  for all  $i \geq i_0$ , we have

$$I(k,n,w) = \binom{k}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} k^{i-1} \binom{k^{(c_w)_i}}{2} k^{2n-2i-2(c_w)_i} = \frac{k-1}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} (k^{2n-i} - k^{2n-i-(c_w)_i}).$$

Since for each i, we have  $(c_w)_i \leq n-i$  by definition of Lehmer code, we obtain

$$I(k,n,w) \le \frac{k^n(k-1)}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} (k^{n-i} - k^{n-i-(n-i)}) = \frac{k(k-1)}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} k^{n-1}(k^{n-i}-1) = \binom{k}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} k^{i-1} \binom{k^{n-i}}{2}.$$

One can observe that the upper bounds on the number of inversions and descents in Proposition  $6.1$ are tight.

**Example 24.** Consider any positive integers  $i_0, n, k$  such that  $i_0 < n$  and  $k \geq 2$ . Let w be a permutation in  $S_n$  defined by  $w_i = n + 1 - i$  for  $i \in [i_0 - 1]$  and  $w_i = i - i_0 + 1$  for  $i \in \{i_0, i_0 + 1, \ldots, n\}$ . This is a special case of a valley permutation, where the increasing part consists of smaller numbers than the decreasing part. We obtain that the Lehmer code of this permutation is  $(c_w)_i = n - i$  for each  $i \in [i_0 - 1]$  and  $(c_w)_i = 0$  for  $i \in \{i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, n\}$ . Therefore we obtain from Theorem 4.1 that the number of inversions in the stable configuration  $C_{k,n,w}$  resulting from firing strategy  $F_w$  is  $\binom{k}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} k^{i-1} \binom{k^{n-i}}{2}$ . This is exactly the upper bound on the number of inversions in  $C_{k,n,w}$  for  $w$ with increasing tail starting at  $i_0$ .

Also observe that Theorem 5.3 and the fact that  $\text{supp}(c_w) = [i_0 - 1]$  imply that  $C_{k,n,w}$  has exactly  $\sum_{i=1}^{i_0-1} (k-1)k^{k-1}$  descents. This is equal to the upper bound on the number of descents in  $C_{k,n,w}$ from Proposition  $6.1$ .

On a similar note, we calculate the lower bound for the number of inversions and descents in  $C_{k,n,w}$  in the case where w has a decreasing tail.
