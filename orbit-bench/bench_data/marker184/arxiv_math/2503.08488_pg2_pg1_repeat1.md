## Introduction 1

In the present paper, we are interested in the phase transition at the critical inverse temperature of the XY model on the three-dimensional square lattice.

To formulate the problem we start by considering a finite subset of a three-dimensional square lattice

$$\mathcal{L} = [-L, L]^3 \bigcap \mathbb{Z}^3. \tag{1.1}$$

 $15$ 

On this lattice the Hamiltonian is defined as

$$H_{L,\nu} := -\sum_{k,l\in\mathcal{L}} J_{k,l} S_k \cdot S_l \tag{1.2}$$

and  $\nu = +$  or 0. Here, depending on the location of the site  $k, S_k \in \mathbb{S}^1$  satisfies different conditions: the lattice is decomposed into two parts,

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}^o \cup \partial \mathcal{L},\tag{1.3}$$

with  $\mathcal{L}^o$  being the interior, and  $\partial \mathcal{L} = \{(z_1, z_2, z_3) \mid \max\{|z_1|, |z_2|, |z_3|\} = L\}$  the boundary; for  $k \in \mathcal{L}^o$ , the only requirement for  $S_k$  is that  $|S_k| = 1$ ; when  $k \in \partial \mathcal{L}$  i.e. it is on the boundary, we consider two boundary conditions: when  $\nu = 0$ , we use the free boundary condition, specifically

$$S_k = 0, \text{ if } k \in \partial \mathcal{L};\tag{1.4}$$

when  $\nu = +$ , the plus boundary condition,

$$S_k = (1,0)^T, \text{ if } k \in \partial \mathcal{L}.$$
