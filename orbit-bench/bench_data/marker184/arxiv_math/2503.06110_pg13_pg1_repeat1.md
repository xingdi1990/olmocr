We finally show that the set  $A_C$  is contained within a neighborhood of size  $N^{-l}e^{-M}$ around a hyperplane in  $\mathbb{F}_q((X^{-1}))^n$ . For any  $x \in C$ , define  $y = e^{(n+1)lM}(x-x_0)$  in  $\mathbb{Z}^n_{\Theta}$ , so that

$$g_t u_x = u_y g_t u_{x_0}.$$

Consider a linear functional  $\phi_{t,C}$  of norm 1 that is zero on the hyperplane  $H_{t,C} = g_t u_{x_0} H_C$ . Then, we have

$$d([e_1], g_t u_x H_C) = d([e_1], u_y H_{t,C}) \asymp d([u_{-y}e_1], H_{t,C}) \asymp \phi_{t,C}(u_{-y}e_1)$$

Thus, if  $x \in A_C$ , we obtain  $\phi_{t,C}(u_{-y}e_1) \lesssim e^{-M}$ , implying that y lies within a neighborhood of size  $O(e^{-\frac{M}{n}})$  of the affine hyperplane in  $\mathbb{F}_q((X^{-1}))^n$  defined by

 $\phi_{t,C}(e_1 - y_1e_2 - \dots - y_ne_{n+1}) = 0.$ 

This means that x lies in a neighborhood of size  $O(N^{-l}e^{-M})$  around an affine hyperplane in  $\mathbb{F}_q((X^{-1}))^n$ . The number of subcubes of C that intersect this neighborhood is bounded by

$$\lesssim_n N^n e^{-M}$$

and thus we obtain

$$\operatorname{card} K_l(C) \ge N^n(1 - O_n(e^{-M})) = N^n - O_n(N^{n - \frac{1}{n+1}}).$$

Now, we proceed to the proof of Theorem 1.1.

*Proof of Theorem 1.1.* To obtain a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of  $K_{\infty}$ , we apply the Mass Distribution Principle. This argument follows identically from the work of [BdS23], but we include the proof here for the sake of completeness.

For  $l \geq 1$ , define

$$b_l = \begin{cases} \lfloor N^n (1 - R_3 e^{-\frac{M}{n}}) \rfloor & \text{if } l_{k-1}^+ < l \le l_k^- \\ 1 & \text{if } l_k^- < l \le l_k^+ . \end{cases}$$

We also replace  $K_{\infty}$  by a Cantor subset  $F_{\infty}$  that is more regular in nature. Removing some cubes in  $K_l$  at each step, we obtain the subset  $F_{\infty} \subset K_{\infty}$  given as

$$F_{\infty} = \bigcap_{l \ge 1} F_l,$$

where each cube C in  $F_{l-1}$  contains exactly  $b_l$  subcubes in  $F_l$ . As stated in Proposition 1.7 of [Fal90], there is a probability measure  $\mu$  that is supported on  $F_{\infty}$ , and for each cube C at level l (with  $C \subset F_l$ ), we have the relationship

$$\mu(C) = \frac{1}{b_1 b_2 \dots b_l}.$$

We propose that if  $\alpha$  is smaller than the limit inferior

$$\liminf_{l \to \infty} \frac{\log(b_1 b_2 \dots b_l)}{l \log N}$$

then there exists a constant  $C = C_{n,N,\alpha}$  such that for every  $x \in \mathbb{F}_q((X^{-1}))$  and for all radii  $r > 0$ ,

$$\mu(B(x,r)) \leq Cr^{\alpha}.$$

To justify this, choose l such that  $N^{-l} < r \leq N^{-l+1}$ . The ball  $B(x,r)$  can intersect no more than  $(3N)^n$  cubes from  $F_l$ . Hence, we have

$$\mu(B(x,r)) \le (3N)^n \cdot (b_1 b_2 \dots b_l)^{-1} \le (3N)^n N^{-l\alpha} \le (3N)^n r^{\alpha}$$
