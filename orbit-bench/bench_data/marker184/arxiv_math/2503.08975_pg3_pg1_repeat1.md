**Theorem 1.6** (Bars [5]). The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has infinitely many points of degree 2 over  $\mathbb{Q}$  if and only if

 $N \in \{1 - 33, 35 - 37, 39 - 41, 43, 46 - 50, 53, 59, 61, 65, 71, 79, 83, 89, 101, 131\}.$ 

**Theorem 1.7** (Jeon [18]). The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has infinitely many points of degree 3 over  $\mathbb{Q}$  if and only if

 $N \in \{1 - 29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 43, 45, 49, 50, 54, 64, 81\}.$ 

**Theorem 1.8** (Hwang, Jeon; Derickx, Orlić [17, 11]). The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has infinitely many points of degree 4 over  $\mathbb{Q}$  if and only if

 $N \in \{1 - 75, 77 - 83, 85 - 89, 91, 92, 94 - 96, 98 - 101, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 104, 107, 111, 103, 10$  $118, 119, 121, 123, 125, 128, 131, 141 - 143, 145, 155, 159, 167, 191$ 

From these results, it is easy to determine the modular curves of the form  $X_0(N)$  with density degree 1, 2, 3 and 4. For example,  $X_0(N)$  has density degree 4 if and only if N occurs in the set of Theorem  $1.8$  but not in the sets of Theorems  $1.6$  and  $1.7$ . Motivated by the recent work of Kadets and Vogt [23] on density degrees, we determine all curves  $X_0(N)$  with density degree equal to 5. Our main result is the following theorem:

**Theorem 1.9.** The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has density degree  $\min(\delta(X_0(N)/\mathbb{Q}))$  equal to 5 if and only if  $N = 109$ .

This main theorem is an important step in determining all curves  $X_0(N)$  with infinitely many quintic points. In fact, if a curve has infinitely many quintic points, then it has to have density degree  $\leq 5$ . And our result completes the classification of all modular curves of density degree  $\leq 5$ . So, in order to determine all curves  $X_0(N)$  with infinitely many quintic points, it suffices to determine for the explicit list  $X_0(N)$  of density degree  $\leq 4$  whether they have infinitely many quintic points. With some extra work, we are able to prove the following:

**Theorem 1.10.** The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has infinitely many points of degree 5 for

 $N \in \{1 - 45, 47 - 58, 61, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 72, 73, 75, 80, 81, 91, 109, 121, 125\}.$ 

The modular curve  $X_0(N)$  has only finitely many points of degree 5 for  $N \ge 192$  and

 $N \in \{46, 59, 60, 62, 66, 69, 70, 71, 76, 78, 84, 87, 90, 93, 94, 95, 97, 102, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 104, 105, 10$  $106, 108, 110, 112 - 117, 119, 120, 122, 124, 126, 127, 129, 130, 132 - 140,$  $144, 146 - 154, 156, 157, 158, 160 - 166, 168 - 190$ 

**Remark 1.11.** With the above theorem, there are 30 levels  $N$  for which we do not know yet if there are infinitely many quintic points. These levels are

> {74, 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 92, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 107,  $111, 118, 123, 128, 131, 141, 142, 143, 145, 155, 159, 167, 191$ .
