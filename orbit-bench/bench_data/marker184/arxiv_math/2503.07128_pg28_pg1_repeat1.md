Here  $B_n$  denotes the ball of radius n centred at the origin. The following property is readily deduced from parabolic estimates:

$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} u_n(t, x) = \overline{p}(x) \quad \text{locally uniformly in } (t, x) \in [0, +\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^n.$$
(4.10)

We claim that the function  $u_n$  fulfils (4.9) for n sufficiently large, depending on  $\varepsilon$ , hence by the previous step it satisfies  $(4.8)$ . Assume by contradiction that this is not the case. Then, for any  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , it holds that

$$t_n := \inf\{t \ge 0 : \exists x \in t \,\widetilde{W}, \ u_n(t,x) \le \underline{u}(x)\} < +\infty.$$

We know from (4.10) that  $t_n \to +\infty$  as  $n \to +\infty$ . In particular,  $t_n > 0$  for n sufficiently large and it follows from the definition of  $t_n$  that

$$\forall t \in [0, t_n), \ \forall x \in t \widetilde{W}, \quad u_n(t, x) > \underline{u}(x), \tag{4.11}$$

and, moreover, being  $t_n \widetilde{W}$  compact, that there exists  $x_n \in t_n \widetilde{W}$  such that

$$u_n(t_n, x_n) = \underline{u}(x_n)$$

Recall that  $\underline{u}$  is a strict subsolution, hence the parabolic strong maximum principle necessarily implies that  $x_n \in \partial(t_n \widetilde{W})$ , that is,  $x_n/t_n \in \partial \widetilde{W}$ .

Consider now  $h_n \in \mathbb{Z}^N$  such that  $\xi_n := x_n - h_n \in [0,1)^N$ . We define

$$\widetilde{u}_n(t,x) := u_n(t_n + t, h_n + x).$$

Up to extraction of a subsequence, the following limits exist:

$$\xi_n \to \xi_\infty \in [0,1]^N, \qquad x_n/t_n \to \zeta \in \partial \widetilde{W}.$$

Also, always up to subsequences, by standard parabolic estimates and spatial periodicity of the equation, the functions  $\widetilde{u}_n$  converge to  $\widetilde{u}_{\infty}$ , an entire solution of (1.1) which fulfils by construction (and by periodicity of  $u$ )

$$\widetilde{u}_{\infty}(0,\xi_{\infty}) = \underline{u}(\xi_{\infty}).\tag{4.12}$$

Moreover, (4.11) rewrites for the  $\widetilde{u}_n$  as

$$\forall t \in [-t_n, 0), \ \forall x \in (t_n + t)\widetilde{W} - \{x_n\}, \quad \widetilde{u}_n(t, x + \xi_n) > \underline{u}(x + \xi_n). \tag{4.13}$$

We assert that this entails

$$\forall t \le 0, \ \forall x \cdot \nu \le \left(1 - \frac{\varepsilon}{3}\right) c_1(\nu) \, t, \quad \widetilde{u}_{\infty}(t, x + \xi_{\infty}) \ge \underline{u}(x + \xi_{\infty}), \tag{4.14}$$

where  $\nu$  is the outward unit normal vector to  $\widetilde{W}$  at the point  $\zeta$  and, we recall,  $c_1(\nu)$  is the speed of the uppermost front of the terrace  $\mathcal{T}^{\nu}$  in the direction  $\nu$ .

The first crucial observation to derive (4.14) is that the *t*-dependent sets  $(t_n + t)\widetilde{W}$  expand at a given boundary point  $(t_n+t)\widetilde{w}(e)e$  with the (positive) constant normal speed  $\widetilde{w}(e)e\cdot\widetilde{\nu}$ , where  $\widetilde{\nu}$  is the outward normal at that point, hence  $e \cdot \tilde{\nu} > 0$ . The second observation is that  $0 \in \partial(t_n W - \{x_n\})$ , for any  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , and that the normal at that point converges to  $\nu$ . The last one is that, because  $\widetilde{W}$ is compact and smooth, it satisfies uniform interior and exterior sphere conditions of some radius  $\rho > 0$  on the boundary, whence its dilation  $(t_n + t)W$  fulfils these conditions with radius  $(t_n + t)\rho$ , which for any t tends to  $+\infty$  as  $n \to +\infty$ . This means that  $(t_n + t)\widetilde{W}$  "flattens" to a half-space around each of its boundary points as  $n \to +\infty$ . These geometric observations are made rigorous in
