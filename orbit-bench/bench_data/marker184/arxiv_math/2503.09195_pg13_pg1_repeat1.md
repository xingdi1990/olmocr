arbitrary pair  $(j_-, j_+)$ . We can see that each ellipsoid can be chosen one after another and disjointly, for each critical point of the function  $\pi_{2,1,1}|_{S_{0,cG}}$  corresponding to each vertex  $v$  of degree at least 3.

We can put an ellipsoid of the standard form centered at some point and containing the point  $(\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0) - \epsilon_{v_0,+,j}, a_{v_0,+,j}) \in F_{D_{\{S_{0,c_G}\}},1}((\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0) + \epsilon_{v_0,-,j}, a_{v_0,-,j}) \in F_{D_{\{S_{0,c_G}\}},1}((\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0) + \epsilon_{v_0,-,j}, a_{v_0,-,j}))$  $F_{D_{\{S_{0,c_{\alpha}}\},1}}$  in the interior in such a way that the boundary  $\overline{D_{j'}}-D_{j'}$  of its closure contains a point  $p_{j'} \in S_{0,c_G}$  with  $\pi_{2,1,1}(p_{j'}) = \pi_{2,1,1}(v_0)$ . We also do in such a way that the intersection  $(\overline{D}_{j'} - D_{j'}) \bigcap \overline{D}_{\{S_{0,c_G}\}}$  is mapped by  $\pi_{2,1,1}$  into  $\mathbb{R}$  as an injective function with the minimum (resp. maximum)  $\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0)$ . Remember that the relations  $0 < \epsilon_{v_0, -,j}, \epsilon_{v_0, +,j} < \epsilon' < \epsilon$  are satisfied and that the numbers  $\epsilon_{v_0, -,j}$ and  $\epsilon_{v_0,-,j_2}$  ( $\epsilon_{v_0,+,j_1}$  and  $\epsilon_{v_0,+,j_2}$ ) are mutually disjoint for distinct numbers  $j_1$  and  $j_2$  and sufficiently small. Remember also that the relation  $a_{v_0,-,j_1} < a_{v_0,-,j_2}$  holds for an arbitrary pair  $(j_1, j_2)$  with  $j_1 < j_2$ , that the relation  $a_{v_0, +, j_1} < a_{v_0, +, j_2}$  holds for an arbitrary pair  $(j_1, j_2)$  with  $j_1 < j_2$ , and that the relations  $a_{v_0, -, j_-} < a_{v_0, +, j_+}$ and  $a_{v_0} - \epsilon' < a_{v_0, -, j_-}, a_{v_0, +, j_+} < a_{v_0} + \epsilon'$  hold for an arbitrary pair  $(j_-, j_+).$  We can see that each ellipsoid can be chosen one after another, disjointly, and disjoint from the previous ellipsoids, for each critical point of the function  $\pi_{2,1,1}|_{S_{0,5G}}$ corresponding to each vertex  $v_0$  of degree 1.

We put ellipsoids  $D_{j'}$  of the standard form one after another to have our desired  $result.$ П

**Proposition 1.** In the present inductive procedure, for a step putting an ellipsoid  $D_{j'}$  centered at the point  $x_{j'} := (\pi_{2,1,1}(v) \pm \epsilon_{v,\pm,j}, a_{v,\pm,j})$  or  $x_{j'} := (\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0) \pm \epsilon_{v,\pm,j}, a_{v,\pm,j})$  $\epsilon_{v_0,\pm,j}, a_{v_0,\pm,j}),$  we abuse the notation from Definition 4. First,  $D_{j'}$  is  $(\mathcal{S}, D_{\mathcal{S}})$ -connected.

In addition, we assume at least one of the following in a step in the procedure.

- At least one ellipsoid centered at a point of the form  $(\pi_{2,1,1}(v) \pm \epsilon_{v,\pm,j_0}, a_{v,\pm,j_0})$ has been put in the case  $v$  is of degree at least 3.
- At least one ellipsoid centered at a point of the form  $(\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0) \pm \epsilon_{v_0,\pm,j_0}, a_{v_0,\pm,j_0})$ has been put in the case  $v_0$  is of degree 1.

Under this additional assumption, the pointed set  $(D_j, x_{j'})$  is  $(\mathcal{S}, D_{\mathcal{S}}, A_{D_{\mathcal{S}}})$ -PLS and it is not  $(S, D_S, A_{D_S})$ -PS.

*Proof.* The first part follows from assumptions on a sufficiently small positive number  $\epsilon_0 > 0$ , another sufficiently small one  $\epsilon > 0$ , and sufficiently small ones with the relations  $0 < \epsilon_{v,-,j}, \epsilon_{v,+,j}, \epsilon_{v_0,-,j}, \epsilon_{v_0,+,j} < \epsilon' < \epsilon.$ 

We see the additional part. The set  $\overline{D_{j'}}$  contains a point of the boundary  $\overline{D_{j'}}$  –  $D_{j'}$  such that the value of the projection  $\pi_{2,1,1}$  there is  $\pi_{2,1,1}(v)$  or  $\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0)$ . The set  $\overline{D_{j'}}$  contains no point from  $F_{D_{\mathcal{S}},2}$  by considering the local shape of the curve  $S_{0,c_G}$ . From the additional assumption, there exists at least one point different from this such that the value of the projection  $\pi_{2,1,1}$  there is  $\pi_{2,1,1}(v)$  or  $\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0)$ in  $F_{D_{\mathcal{S}},1}$ . We can easily check that the pointed set  $(D_j, x_{j'})$  is  $(\mathcal{S}, D_{\mathcal{S}}, A_{D_{\mathcal{S}}})$ -PLS and it is not  $(S, D_S, A_{D_S})$ -PS.  $\sqcup$ 

We present another example as our new result.

**Theorem 5.** We also abuse the notation from Definition 4 here. In our steps here, for each pair of ellipsoids of the standard form centered at  $(\pi_{2,1,1}(v_0)$  -
