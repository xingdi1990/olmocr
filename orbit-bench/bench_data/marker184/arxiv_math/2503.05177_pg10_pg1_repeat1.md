From now on we will drop the subscript from the notation  $C^{\leq k,w}$ .

For a sequence s denote by  $\sigma(s)$  and  $d(s)$  respectively its Schnirelmann density and asymptotic density. Namely,

$$\sigma(s) = \inf_{n} \frac{A(n)}{n},$$

and

$$d(s) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{A(n)}{n} \quad \text{if it exists,}$$

where  $A(n) = |\{i : s_i < n\}|.$ 

Recall Mann's theorem, relating sumsets to Schnirelmann densities:

**Theorem 3.4** (Mann's Theorem [Man42]). For subsets A and B of  $\mathbb{N}$ , if the sumset  $A + B \neq \mathbb{N}$ , then

$$\sigma(A+B) \ge \sigma(A) + \sigma(B) \quad holds.$$

We now use Mann's theorem together with the results above to establish Theorem  $1.4.$ 

Proof of Theorem 1.4. By Lemma 3.3 it is enough to prove  $P(C^{\leq k,w}) = 1$ . By Lemma 3.1  $C^{k,w}$  is a tail event, and by Lemma 3.3 we have  $P(C^{\leq k,w}) = P(C^{k,w})$ , so it is enough to prove that  $P(C^{\leq k,w}) > 0$ . From  $\mathbb{E}X < k$  if follows that  $d(\{W_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}) > \frac{1}{k}$ . Introduce the random variable  $N$  by

$$N = \min\left\{n : \forall m \ge n, \quad \frac{A(m)}{m} > \frac{1}{k}\right\}.$$

Since  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(N=n) = 1$ , it follows that  $\exists n_0$  such that  $P(N=n_0) > 0$ .

We now distinguish two cases.

Case 1:  $1 \in \text{Supp}X$ .

We have

 $P(N = n_0 \text{ for the sequence generated by } \{X_i\}_{i>n_0}) > 0,$ 

and since  $1 \in \text{Supp}X$ , we have

$$P(X_1 = X_2 = \dots = X_{n_0} = 1) > 0.$$

Since these two events deal with distinct parts of the i.i.d. sequence  $\{X_i\}_{i>n_0}$ , with positive probability both events occur simultaneously. Now, let us evaluate the Schnirelmann density  $\sigma(\{W_i\}_{i>1})$  for such sequences of gaps. We have

$$\frac{A(n)}{n} \ge \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n \le n_0\\ \frac{1}{2} & \text{if } n_0 < n \le 2n_0\\ \frac{1}{k} & \text{if } n > 2n_0 \end{cases}$$

where the first two inequalities follow from the choice of the first  $n_0$  gaps and the last one from the condition  $N = n_0$ .

Thus we get  $P\left(\sigma(W) \geq \frac{1}{k}\right) > 0$  and Mann's theorem implies asymptotic  $\leq k$ -completeness with the same positive probability.

Case 2:  $1 \notin \text{Supp}X$ .
