On contrary, assume that  $0 \notin Conv\left\{\bigcup_{j \in \Lambda} \partial H_j(x^*)\right\}$ . Since,  $Conv\left\{\bigcup_{j \in \Lambda} \partial H_j(x^*)\right\}$  and  $\{0\}$  are closed and convex sets then with the help of theorem of separation, there exists  $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$  and  $b \in \mathbb{R}$  such that  $v^T 0 \ge b$  and  $v^T d < b \,\forall d \in \mathbb{R}$  $Conv\Big\{\bigcup \partial H_j(x^*)\Big\}$ . Jointly both inequality contradicts (3.1). Hence,  $0 \in Conv\Big\{\bigcup \partial H_j(x^*)\Big\}$ . Conversely, it needs to be proven that if  $0 \in Conv\left\{\bigcup \partial H_j(x^*)\right\}$ , then  $x^*$  is a Pareto critical point for  $H$ . For this purpose, define  $\check{H}(x) = \max_{j \in \Lambda} H_j(x) - H_j(x^*)$ . Then, by item (ii) of Theorem 2.2,  $\partial \check{H}(x) = Conv\left\{\bigcup \partial H_j(x)\right\}$ . Hence, the assumption leads to  $0 \in Conv\left\{\bigcup \partial H_j(x)\right\}$ , implying  $x^* = \arg\min_{x \in D} \check{H}(x)$ . On the contrary, if  $x^*$  is not a Pareto critical point, then according to Definition 2.3, there exists  $s \in D$  such that  $\nabla h_i(x^*, \xi_i)^T s < 0$ , for all  $i \in I_i(x^*), j \in \Lambda$ , i.e.,  $H'_i(x^*, s) < 0$  for all j. Then there exists some  $\eta > 0$  sufficiently small such that  $H_i(x^* + \eta s) < H_i(x^*)$  for all j which implies  $\check{H}(x^* + \eta s) < 0 = \check{H}(x^*)$  holds for some  $(x^* + \eta s) \in D$ . This contradicts the fact that  $x^* = \arg\min_{x \in D} \check{H}(x)$ . As a consequence, the assumption that  $x^*$  is not a Pareto critical point is incorrect, and  $x^*$  is indeed a Pareto critical point for  $H$ .  $\Box$ 

**Theorem 3.1.** *If*  $h_i(x,\xi_i)$  *is continuously differentiable and convex for each*  $j \in \Lambda$  *and*  $\xi_i \in U$ *, then*  $x^* \in D$  *is a weak* efficient solution solution for  $OWC_{P(U)}$  if and only if

$$0 \in conv\left(\cup_{i=1}^{m} \partial H_{j}(x^{*})\right)$$

*Proof.* Let  $x^*$  be a weak efficient solution solution for  $OWC_{P(U)}$ . It must be shown that  $0 \in Conv_{j \in \Lambda} \partial H_j(x^*)$ . Since given function  $h_i(x,\xi_i)$  is continuously differentiable and convex for each *j* and  $\xi_i \in U$ , then  $h_i(x,\xi_i)$  will be locally Lipschitz continuous for all  $i \in \bar{\Lambda}$ . Then  $0 \in Conv\{\cup_{j \in \Lambda} \partial H_j(x^*)\}$  (see Theorem 4.3 in [71] ).

Conversely, by assumption  $0 \in Conv\{\cup_{j \in \Lambda} \partial H_j(x^*)\}$  it is clear that  $x^*$  is Pareto critical point. Then for atleast one  $j^0$ , it is established that  $H'_{\mathfrak{p}}(x^*, d) \ge 0$ ,  $\forall d \in D - \{x^*\}$ . Now, by using the Definition 2.2, it follows that

$$\nabla h_{i^0}(x^*, \xi_i)^T d \ge 0, \ \forall \ d \in D, \ i \in I_{i^0}(x^*). \tag{3.2}$$

By convexity of  $H_i$  and  $h_i(x,\xi_i)$ , it is obtained that

$$h_{i^0}(x,\xi_i) \ge h_{i^0}(x^*,\xi_i) + \nabla h_{i^0}(x^*,\xi_i)^T (x-x^*), \ \forall \ i \in I_{i^0}(x^*) \text{ and } x, \ x^* \in D.$$

Since the last term of the latest inequality is positive by  $(3.2)$ , it is established that

$$h_{j^0}(x,\xi_i) \ge h_{j^0}(x^*,\xi_i), \ \forall \ i \in I_{j^0}(x^*),$$

and therefore

$$H_{j^0}(x) \ge H_{j^0}(x^*), \ \forall x \in D,$$

i.e.,  $x^*$  is weak efficient solution.
