*Proof.* One has to impose  $d_{1,1} = 0$  and  $d_{p,j} = 0$  in eq. (5.7). Then, coefficients  $\omega_{i,j}$  vanish, because all the successive commutators  $[K(h), \ldots, [K(h), K(h)] \ldots]$  appearing in the BCH formula applied to  $\mathrm{e}^{K(h)}\,\mathrm{e}^{\widetilde{K}(h)}\,$  contain only pure imaginary terms up to order  $\,\mathcal{O}(h^{2p+1})$  .  $\Box$ 

In consequence, if the problem (5.1) is defined in a Lie group  $\mathcal{G}$ , then the scheme  $S_h$  of order  $p$  is conjugate to a method that preserves the Lie group structure up to order  $2p + 1$ . This is so up to order  $2p + 2$ if  $\Psi_h$  is symmetric-conjugate and the order  $p$  is even, due to the particular structure of  $K_h$  in that case [5]. On the other hand, if  $\Psi_h$  is symmetric-conjugate and its order p is odd, then the resulting AC method is time-symmetric and of order  $p+1$ .

## New alternating-conjugate methods $5.2$

The analysis of the previous subsection shows that, in addition to concatenating a given method  $\Psi_h$  of order  $p$  (say palindromic or symmetric-conjugate) with the same scheme with complex conjugate coefficients, one can also get an alternating-conjugate method of order  $p \geq 2$  by considering  $\Psi_h$  as in Proposition 5.1, namely by requiring the following order conditions:

$$\Re(k_{1,1}) = \frac{1}{2}, \qquad \Re(k_{p,j}) = 0; \quad j = 1, \dots, c(p)$$
  
$$k_{\ell,j} = 0, \qquad \ell = 2, \dots, p-1; \ j = 1, \dots, c(\ell).$$
 (5.12)

The simplest AC method of order  $p=2$  corresponds of course to the composition  $S_h = \Phi_{\alpha h} \Phi_{\overline{\alpha}h}$  with

$$\Phi_{\alpha h} = e^{K(h)}\n$$
 and  $K(h) = \alpha hM + \alpha^2 h^2 Y_2 + \alpha^3 h^3 Y_3 + \cdots$ 

By imposing  $\Re(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}, \Re(\alpha^2) = 0$  we get  $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm i)$ , i.e., we recover method (5.2).

Analogously, for an AC method of order 3 within this family one has to take  $\Psi_h = \Phi_{\alpha_1 h} \Phi_{\alpha_2 h} \Phi_{\alpha_3 h}$  to satisfy the 5 required conditions (5.12). Although there are solutions with  $\alpha_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ , it is more efficient to consider  $\Phi_h$  in the composition (5.4) as a 2nd-order time-symmetric method, namely

$$\Psi_h = \Psi_{\alpha_1 h}^{[2]} \Psi_{\alpha_2 h}^{[2]} \cdots \Psi_{\alpha_r h}^{[2]}.\n$$
(5.13)

Now the number of order conditions  $(5.12)$  to achieve a method of order 3, 4, 5, 6 is, respectively, 2, 4, 7 and 11. This is the strategy we follow next to construct higher order schemes with the minimum number of basic methods (or *stages*). We denote, for brevity, the whole AC method by its sequence of coefficients:

$$S_h = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_r, \overline{\alpha}_1, \overline{\alpha}_2, \dots, \overline{\alpha}_r).$$

The two order conditions,  $\Re(k_{1,1}) = \frac{1}{2}, \Re(k_{3,1}) = 0$  can be satisfied with just one basic scheme, Order 3.  $\Psi_{\alpha_1 h}^{[2]}$  , if

$$\alpha_1 = \frac{1}{2} \pm i \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}.$$

In this way we recover the scheme (2.5), which is both symmetric-conjugate and AC. Notice that if  $\Psi_h^{[2]}$  is taken as the Strang splitting  $(2.3)$  for two operators, then the number of exponentials is 5 instead of 12 with a composition of the Lie-Trotter scheme.
