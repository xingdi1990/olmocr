Throughout we assume the Riemann Hypothesis, in the strong form that the nontrivial zeros are also simple. We also need to assume the following:

**Hypothesis D.** The level curves  $Re(\eta(s)) = 0$  are differentiable. This is automatic except at isolated points where  $\eta'(s) = 0$ , so we are really assuming that when  $\eta'(s) = 0$ ,  $\arg(\eta(s)) \neq \pm \pi/2$ . This prevents the level curves from branching. Hypothesis D is plausible because  $\pm \pi/2$  are only two points on the unit circle, while the zeros of  $\eta'(s)$  form a countable set.

Here's a summary of the sections of the paper:

- §1 Classification of the zeros of  $\zeta(s)$  and  $\zeta'(s)$  into different types by means of the level curves, and results on the asymptotics of the types.
- §2 Computation and classification of 10<sup>6</sup> zeros of  $\zeta'(s)$  near  $T =$  $10^{10}$ .
- **§3** Two lemmas.
- $§4$  A closer look at the type 2 zeros, and the curvature of the level curve.
- §5 A canonical bijection between the complex zeros  $\rho'$  of  $\zeta'(s)$ , and the complex zeros  $\rho''$  of  $\zeta''(s)$ .
- §6 Adaptation of a theorem of Marden, and the location of  $\rho''$ relative to  $\rho'$ .
- §7 Curvature of the level curve at  $\rho'$  in terms of all the other zeros  $\lambda' \neq \rho'.$
- §8 Appendix: With  $p_A(z)$  the characteristic polynomial of a unitary matrix A, we give a classification of the zeros of  $p_A(z)$ and  $p'_{A}(z)$  analogous to that in §1.

## 1. CLASSIFICATION OF ZEROS

**Proposition 1.** With the usual indexing  $\gamma_1 < \gamma_2 < \ldots$  of the imaginary parts of the zeros of  $\zeta(s)$ , every odd indexed zero lies on a contour  $Im(\eta(s)) < 0$ . Every even indexed zero lies on a contour  $Im(\eta(s)) > 0$ .

*Proof.* This follows from Lemma 2 below, which says that as  $t$  increases, the argument of  $\eta(1/2 + it)$  decreases by exactly  $\pi$  between
