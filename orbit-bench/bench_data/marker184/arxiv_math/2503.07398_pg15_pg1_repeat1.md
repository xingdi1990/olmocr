$Proof.$  The result follows from the observation that

$$\operatorname{rk}(\mathbb{1}_{A}^{C_{0}\oplus C_{1}})=\operatorname{rk}(\mathbb{1}_{A}^{C_{0}}\oplus\mathbb{1}_{A}^{C_{1}})\geq \operatorname{rk}(\mathbb{1}_{A}^{C_{0}}),$$

for any measurable subset  $A$  of  $X$ .

Observe that  $\mathcal{A}_{\kappa}(\mathcal{X})$  does not necessarily contains a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module. For instance, if  $\mathcal{X}$  has  $\aleph_1$  coarsely connected components, no coarse  $\mathcal{X}$ -module of rank  $\aleph_0$  can be faithful. However, it is possible to fully characterise the cardinals for which the approximable category contains a faithful module.

**Lemma 2.10.** Let  $\mathcal{X}$  be a LFCM space with an infinite discrete partition. For any two discrete partitions  $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$  and  $\{B_i\}_{i\in J}$ , the cardinalities of I and J are equal. Moreover, for an infinite cardinal  $\kappa$ , the following statements are equivalent:

- (1)  $\kappa$  is greater than or equal to the cardinality of a discrete partition of  $\mathcal{X}$ ;
- (2)  $\mathcal{A}_{\kappa}(\mathcal{X})$  contains a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module;
- (3)  $\mathcal{A}_{\kappa}(\mathcal{X})$  contains an ample  $\mathcal{X}$ -module.

*Proof.* Since  $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$  is a discrete partition of  $\mathcal{X}$ , for each  $j\in J$ , there exist only finitely many  $i\in I$ such that  $B_j \cap A_i \neq \emptyset$ . Consequently,  $|J| \leq |I| \times \aleph_0$ . Similarly, one has  $|I| \leq |J| \times \aleph_0$ . Note that if  $\mathcal{X}$  admits an infinite discrete partition, then any discrete partition of  $\mathcal{X}$  must also be infinite. It follows that

$$I| = |I| \times \aleph_0 = |J| \times \aleph_0 = |J|.$$

For the second part of the statement, note that every ample  $\mathcal{X}$ -module is necessarily faithful. Conversely, given a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module C, let H be a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Define the  $\mathcal{X}$ -module  $C \otimes H$ , where the underlying Hilbert space is  $H_C \otimes H$  and the representation  $\mathbb{1}_{\bullet}^{C \otimes H}$ is given by  $\mathbb{1}^{C\otimes H}_A = \mathbb{1}^C_A \otimes \mathrm{id}_H$  for all subsets A. It is straightforward to verify that  $C \otimes H$  is an ample  $\mathcal{X}$ -module with the same rank as  $C$ .

It remains to establish the equivalence of (1) and (2). If  $\kappa$  exceeds the cardinality of the discrete partition, then the module constructed in Example 2.1 is a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module of rank  $|I|$ . Conversely, suppose C is a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module of rank  $\kappa$ . Define  $I_C = \{i \in I \mid A_i \cap \text{dom}_1(C) \neq \emptyset\} \subseteq I$ . By discretising  $\mathcal{X}$  and dom<sub>1</sub>(C), there exists a gauge  $E \in \mathcal{E}^I$  such that

$$I = E[I_C] = \bigcup_{i \in I_C} E[\{i\}].$$

It follows that the cardinality of I is given by  $|I_C| \times \sup_{i \in I_C} |E[\{i\}]|$ . Since  $|E[\{i\}]|$  is finite for all  $i \in I$ , we deduce  $|I| = |I_C|$ .

We shall focus on the case of countably generated LFCM spaces. Accordingly, we aim to determine the cardinals  $\kappa$  for which the approximable category  $\mathcal{A}_{\kappa}(\mathcal{X})$  contains a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module. The following lemma addresses this question in the connected case.

**Lemma 2.11.** If  $\mathcal{X}$  is a countably generated LFCM space with a countable number of connected components, then  $\mathcal{A}_{\aleph_0}(\mathcal{X})$  contains a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module.

*Proof.* Let  $\{A_i\}_{i\in I}$  be a discrete partition of  $\mathcal{X}$ . By considering the discretisation  $\mathcal{I} = (I, \mathcal{E}^I, \mathcal{P}(I))$ of  $\mathcal{X}$ , as in Proposition 1.9, we obtain a locally finite, countably generated coarse space. We may select a generating set  $\{E_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  for  $\mathcal{I}$  satisfying the following conditions:

- (1) For every  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the inclusion  $E_n \subset E_{n+1}$  holds;
- (2) For every  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the entourage  $E_n$  is a gauge;
- (3) For every entourage  $F \in \mathcal{E}^I$ , there exists  $n \in \mathbb{N}$  such that  $F \subset E_n$ .

Since  $\mathcal{I}$  has a countable amount of connected components, there exists a sequence  $\{i_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subset I$  such that for every  $j \in J$  there are  $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$  such that  $(i_k, j) \in E_n$ . As  $\mathcal{I}$  is locally finite, the sets  $E_n[i_k]$ are finite for all  $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Hence,

$$I = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n[i_k]$$

is at most countable. Consequently,  $\mathcal{X}$  admits a countable discrete partition. By Lemma 2.10, the approximable category  $\mathcal{A}_{\aleph_0}(\mathcal{X})$  contains a faithful  $\mathcal{X}$ -module.  $\Box$ 

In the case where  $\mathcal{X}$  has an uncountable number of connected components, the theorem above does not hold. For instance, consider an uncountable disjoint union of copies of  $\mathbb{N}$ , equipped with an extended metric

$$d(n,m) = \begin{cases} |n-m|, & \text{if } n,m \text{ belong to the same copy of } \mathbb{N}; \\ \infty, & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$
