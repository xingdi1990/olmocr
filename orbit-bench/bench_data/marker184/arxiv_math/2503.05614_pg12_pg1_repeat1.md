## Arithmetic Duality and Functional Equations $5.2$

The connection between the DACC framework and L-functions is further strengthened by the relationship between Poitou-Tate duality and the functional equation of L-functions.

**Proposition 5.5** (Arithmetic Duality and Height Pairing). For an elliptic curve  $E/\mathbb{Q}$ , the pairing induced by Poitou-Tate duality on the adelic complex coincides with the Néron-Tate height pairing on  $E(\mathbb{Q})$ .

*Proof Sketch.* We outline this result in three steps:

**Step 1: Establishing Derived Duality.** For each local component, we prove:

 $R\Gamma(\mathbb{Q}_v, \mathcal{D}_v) \simeq R\text{Hom}(R\Gamma(\mathbb{Q}_v, \mathcal{D}_v), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$ 

For the global component:

 $R\Gamma_{\text{global}}(E, \mathcal{D}) \simeq R\text{Hom}(R\Gamma_{\text{global}}(E, \mathcal{D}), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$ 

Using the mapping cone construction, we derive the duality for the adelic complex.

**Step 2: Connection to Height Pairing.** For  $P, Q \in E(\mathbb{Q})$ , we show that the pairing  $\langle P, Q \rangle$ induced by duality equals the Néron-Tate height pairing  $\hat{h}(P,Q)$  by analyzing local and global components.

For the archimedean component, we use the connection between periods and heights.

For non-archimedean components, we use the theory of local heights and their relation to Galois  $\text{cohomology.}$ 

The global pairing emerges as the sum of these local contributions, matching the Néron-Tate height pairing.

**Step 3: Determinant Interpretation.** The determinant of this pairing on a basis of  $E(\mathbb{Q})/E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ gives the regulator  $R_E$ , which explains its appearance in the formula for  $\det(d_r)$ .

The proof establishes explicit isomorphisms in the derived category and verifies the duality relations at each place through detailed Galois cohomology calculations.  $\Box$ 

**Theorem 5.6** (Arithmetic Duality). The adelic complex  $C^{\bullet}(E)$  satisfies a derived version of Poitou-Tate duality:

 $C^{\bullet}(E) \simeq R\text{Hom}(C^{\bullet}(E), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$ 

This duality reflects the functional equation of the  $L$ -function:

$$\Lambda(E,s) = \varepsilon_E \cdot \Lambda(E,2-s)$$

*Proof.* **Step 1:** Local and global duality.

For each local component, we establish:

 $R\Gamma(\mathbb{Q}_v, \mathcal{D}_v) \simeq R\text{Hom}(R\Gamma(\mathbb{Q}_v, \mathcal{D}_v), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$ 

This follows from local Tate duality in Galois cohomology.

For the global component:

$$R\Gamma_{\text{global}}(E,\mathcal{D}) \simeq R\text{Hom}(R\Gamma_{\text{global}}(E,\mathcal{D}),\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}(1))[1]$$
