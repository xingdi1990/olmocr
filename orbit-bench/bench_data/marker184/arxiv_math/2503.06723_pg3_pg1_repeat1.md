where  $\varphi(z)$  is described by the capacitary formula induced by  $F_0$  (see (3.13)). It is worth noting that a similar analysis in the case of non local functionals of convolution type has been performed in a recent paper by R. Alicandro, M.S. Gelli and C. Leone [4]. From a technical point of view we mainly adopt the strategy exploited in  $[4]$ , which in turn is inspired by [5]. The idea is to use a separation-of-scales argument, formalized in [5] and then deal with the non locality of our functionals to estimate the contribution near the perforations. A crucial role is played by a discrete version of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, which is derived from the corresponding non local variant proved in [4]. This inequality allows us to show the convergence of minimum problems on unbounded domains, defining the approximating capacitary densities, to the limit energy density defined in  $(3.13)$ .

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce some notation. In Section 3 we present the setting of the problem and state the main result of the paper. In Section 4 we recall some preliminary results. In Section 5 we state and prove the discrete version of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality and some other results which are instrumental for the proof of the main theorem, which is the core of Section  $6$ .

## 2 Notation

In what follows  $d, m \in \mathbb{N}$  will be two fixed natural numbers denoting the dimension of the reference and the target spaces of the functions we consider, respectively. The set of vectors  $\{e_1,\ldots,e_d\}$  will denote the standard orthonormal basis in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Given  $t\in\mathbb{R}$ , [t] denotes the integer part of  $t$ ; for  $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ ,  $r > 0$ ,  $Q(\alpha, r) = \alpha + (-r/2, r/2)^d$  (if  $\alpha = 0$ , simply  $Q_r$ ) is the open cube in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  of center  $\alpha$  and side length  $r$ . We denote by  $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$  the unit sphere in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ subset of  $\mathbb{R}^d$  then dist $(x, A) = \inf\{|y - x| : y \in A\}$ ;  $\mathcal{A}^{\text{reg}}(A)$  is the family of open subsets with Lipschitz boundary. We use standard notation for  $\Gamma$ -convergence [10]. Unless otherwise stated,  $C$  will always denote a generic strictly positive constant that may change from line to line.

## 3 Setting of the problem and the main result

We fix  $p \in (1, d)$  and we let  $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$  be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. For fixed  $\varepsilon > 0$ , we denote by  $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$  the lattice  $\Omega_{\varepsilon} := \varepsilon \mathbb{Z}^d \cap \Omega$  and later for a given infinitesimal sequence  $\varepsilon_i$ we will use the notation  $\Omega_j := \Omega_{\varepsilon_j}$ . We denote by  $\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^m)$  the set of functions

$$\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m) := \{u : \Omega_{\varepsilon} \to \mathbb{R}^m\}$$

We will identify the functions in  $\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$  by their piecewise constant interpolation on the cells of the lattice  $\varepsilon \mathbb{Z}^d$  that is

$$\mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m) = \{u:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^m: u \text{ constant on } \alpha + [0,\varepsilon)^d \text{ for any } \alpha \in \Omega_{\varepsilon}\}.$$

Given  $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}^d$  and  $E \subset \Omega$  we define

$$E_{\varepsilon}(\xi) := \{ \alpha \in E \mid \alpha + \varepsilon \xi \in E \} \cap \varepsilon \mathbb{Z}^d. \tag{3.1}$$

Given a function  $v \in \mathcal{A}_{\varepsilon}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$ , we denote by  $D^{\xi}_{\varepsilon}v$  the different quotient along the direction  $\xi$ ; i.e. for  $\alpha \in \Omega_{\varepsilon}(\xi)$ 

$$D_{\varepsilon}^{\xi}v(\alpha) := \frac{v(\alpha + \varepsilon\xi) - v(\alpha)}{\varepsilon|\xi|}$$
