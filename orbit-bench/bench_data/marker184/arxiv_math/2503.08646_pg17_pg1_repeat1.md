$$\mu_{u^{\perp}} + \mu_{v^{\perp}} = 0, \qquad (4.27)$$

where the index  $\perp$  refers to the projection to the subspace orthogonal to  $w, w^*$ ,  $\mu_u^{\perp} = \sum_{i=2}^n \left( u_i \otimes u_i^{\dagger} - u_i^* \otimes u_i^t \right).$ Clearly, the latter equation means that i.e.  $\operatorname{Span}\left(\left\{u_i\right\}_{i=2}^n\right) = \operatorname{Span}\left(\left\{v_i^*\right\}_{i=2}^n\right).$ 

It is also clear from above that the map  $(w, u^{\perp}) \mapsto (u, v, w)$  is the one described  $\Box$ in the proposition.

## General embeddings $\mu = 0$ 5.

To start with, we prove the following lemma (we assume  $\mu^{-1}(0)$  connected):

**Lemma 1.** An orbit  $L \subset \mu^{-1}(0)$  is Lagrangian only if  $L \simeq \mu^{-1}(0)$ .

*Proof.* Start with the definition of the moment map:  $d\mu[v] = \omega(\bullet, v)$ , where v is a vector field generating the Lie group action. Take a point  $p \in L$ : contracting the above equality with an arbitrary vector field tangent to  $\mu^{-1}(0)$  we find that

$$0 = \omega(w, v), \quad \text{where} \quad v \in \mathcal{T}_p L, \quad w \in \mathcal{T}_p \mu^{-1}(0)$$

$$(5.1)$$

Now, suppose  $v_1 \n\t\ldots v_\ell$  is a basis of vectors tangent to the orbit  $L \subset \mu^{-1}(0)$  but not a basis in  $T_p\mu^{-1}(0)$ . In this case there is a non-zero vector  $w \in T_p\mu^{-1}(0)/T_pL$ . By (5.1) the restriction of  $\omega$  to Span $(\mathrm{T}_pL, w)$  is zero. As a result, L is not Lagrangian unless  $T_p\mu^{-1}(0) \simeq T_pL$  at every point implying that  $\mu^{-1}(0) \simeq L$ .  $\Box$ 

Thus, if one wishes to find Lagrangian submanifolds within  $\mu^{-1}(0)$ , one should search for cases where  $\mu^{-1}(0)$  is a single orbit. Let us recall how this works in the case of  $\mathrm{SU}(n)$  flag manifolds.

 $\mathrm{SU}(n)$  flag manifolds. We will now use the method employed in the proof  $5.1.$ of Proposition 4 to show that the flag manifold featuring in Proposition 2 is  $\mu^{-1}(0)$ . Indeed, for any matrix  $\mu_i := g_i \Lambda_i g_i^{\dagger}$  in the orbit of  $\Lambda_i$  given by (3.4) one has the
