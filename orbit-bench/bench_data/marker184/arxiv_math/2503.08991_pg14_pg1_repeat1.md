*Proof of Theorem 3.7.* First, note that  $f_A$  has a unique measure of maximal entropy  $\eta$  and its push forward measure  $\mu = \pi_* \eta$  is a measure of maximal entropy of  $g_A$ , because  $\pi$  is bounded to one which guarantees  $h_{\mu}(g_A) = h_{\eta}(f_A)$  (e.g. see [39]) and, hence,  $h(g_A) = h(f_A) = h_{\eta}(f_A) = h_{\mu}(g_A)$  (see [25] for the definition of metric  $\text{entropy}$ ).

Next let us prove the uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy of  $g_A$ . To do so, let us fix any measure of maximal entropy  $\hat{\mu}$  for  $g_A$ . Theorem 2.12 implies that  $g_A$  has the periodic specification property, which ensures the existence of a sequence  $\hat{\mu}_n$  of measures supported on periodic points  $p_n$  such that  $\hat{\mu}$  is the weak<sup>\*</sup> limit of  $\hat{\mu}_n$  (see [25, Proposition 21.8]). Let  $q_n$  be any periodic point  $q_n \in \pi^{-1}(p_n)$  and let  $\hat{\eta}_n$  be the measure supported on  $q_n$ . Then  $\hat{\mu}_n = \pi_*(\hat{\eta}_n)$ . Without loss of generality we may assume that  $(\hat{\eta}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  converge in the weak\* topology to a measure  $\hat{\eta}$ . But then, by continuity of the push-forward operator  $\pi_*$  we have  $\pi_*\hat{\eta} = \hat{\mu}$  and as a  $consequence$ 

$$h(g_A) = h_{\hat{\mu}}(g_A) \le h_{\hat{\eta}}(f_A) \le h(f_A) = h(g_A).$$

This proves that  $\hat{\eta} = \eta$  and consequently that  $\hat{\mu} = \mu$ , that is,  $\mu$  is the unique measure of maximal entropy of  $g_A$ .

It remains to prove that  $\mu$  is the weak<sup>\*</sup> limit of  $\mu_n$ . A difficulty that arise is how to lift precisely the sequence  $(\mu_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  to the Torus since the sequence  $(\eta_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ defined by

$$\eta_n = \frac{1}{\text{Per}_n(f_A)} \sum_{p \in P_n(f_A)} \delta_p,$$

which converge to  $\eta$  by Bowen's proof, does not project to  $(\mu_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ . Indeed, the antipodal periodic points are also in the pre-image of periodic points of  $g_A$ . An attempt would be to include the antipodal periodic points in the definition of these measures and consider the sequence  $(\hat{\eta}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  defined by

$$\hat{\eta}_n = \frac{1}{\operatorname{Per}_n(f_A) + \operatorname{Per}_n^-(f_A)} \sum_{p \in P_n(f_A) \cup P_n^-(f_A)} \delta_p.$$

But  $\hat{\eta}_n$  still does not project to  $\mu_n$  and the problem relies on the existence of the spines (points with a single pre-image). Thus, we rule out these points as follows: for each  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , let

$$P_n^*(g_A) = \{ p \in P_n(g_A) : \#\pi^{-1}(p) = 2 \}, \quad \text{Per}_n^*(g_A) = \#P_n^*(g_A),$$
  
and 
$$\hat{\mu}_n = \frac{1}{\text{Per}_n^*(g_A)} \sum_{p \in P_n^*(g_A)} \delta_p.$$

Since there are only four points with a single pre-image, we have

$$|\operatorname{Per}_n(g_A) - \operatorname{Per}_n^*(g_A)| \le 4.$$

Thus,  $(\mu_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  and  $(\hat{\mu}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$  converge weakly\* to exactly the same measure, provided the limit exists. For each  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , let

$$P_n^*(f_A) = \pi^{-1}(P_n^*(g_A))$$
 and  $\operatorname{Per}_n^*(f_A) = \#P_n^*(f_A) = 2\operatorname{Per}_n^*(g_A),$ 

and note that for  $n$  sufficiently large we have

$$\frac{\operatorname{Per}_n(f_A)}{2} \le \operatorname{Per}_n^*(f_A) \le 3 \operatorname{Per}_n(f_A).$$
