Therefore  $\sigma$  conjugates  $\varphi$  and Q. In particular it follows that  $\text{Fix}(Q) \subset \mathbb{R}^m$  is sub vector space of dimension r. From (6) we know that Q is an involution. Thus from statements  $(i)$  and  $(ii)$  we have that there is a linear change of variables such that in these new variables  $Q$  is given by,

$$Q(x_1,\ldots,x_m)=(x_1,\ldots,x_r,-x_{r+1},\ldots,-x_m).$$

The result now follows from the fact that  $\varphi$  is  $C^k$ -conjugated to  $Q$  by  $\sigma$ .  $\Box$ 

## APPENDIX B. POINCARÉ COMPACTIFICATION

Let  $X$  be a planar *polynomial* vector field of degree  $n$  as our polynomial differential systems of Theorem 1. The *Poincaré* compactified vector field  $p(X)$  is an analytic vector field on  $\mathbb{S}^2$  constructed as follow (for more details see [17, Chap- $\text{ter } 5$ .

First we identify  $\mathbb{R}^2$  with the plane  $(x_1, x_2, 1)$  in  $\mathbb{R}^3$  and define the *Poincaré* sphere as  $\mathbb{S}^2 = \{y = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 = 1\}.$  We define the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere and the equator respectively by  $H_{+} = \{y \in \mathbb{S}^{2}: y_{3} > 0\}, H_{-} = \{y \in \mathbb{S}^{2}: y_{3} < 0\}$  and  $\mathbb{S}^{1} = \{y \in \mathbb{S}^{2}: y_{3} = 0\}.$ <br>Consider now the projections  $f_{\pm}: \mathbb{R}^{2} \to H_{\pm}$  g

$$f_{\pm}(x_1,x_2) = \pm \Delta(x_1,x_2)(x_1,x_2,1),$$

where  $\Delta(x_1, x_2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 1)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ . These two maps define two copies of  $X$ , one copy  $X^+$  in  $H_+$  and one copy  $X^-$  in  $H_-$ . Consider the vector field  $X' = X^+ \cup X^$ defined in  $\mathbb{S}^2 \setminus \mathbb{S}^1$ . Note that the *infinity* of  $\mathbb{R}^2$  is identified with the equator  $\mathbb{S}^1$ . The Poincaré compactified vector field  $p(X)$  is the analytic extension of  $X'$  from  $\mathbb{S}^2 \setminus \mathbb{S}^1$  to  $\mathbb{S}^2$  given by  $y_3^{n-1}X'$ . The *Poincaré* disk  $\mathbb{D}$  is the projection of the closed northern hemisphere to  $y_3 = 0$  under  $(y_1, y_2, y_3) \mapsto (y_1, y_2)$  (the vector field given by this projection is also denoted by  $p(X)$ ). Note that to know the behavior  $p(X)$ near  $\mathbb{S}^1$  is the same than to know the behavior of X near the infinity. We define the local charts of  $\mathbb{S}^2$  by  $U_i = \{y \in \mathbb{S}^2 : y_i > 0\}$  and  $V_i = \{y \in \mathbb{S}^2 : y_i < 0\}$  for  $i \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ . In these charts we define  $\phi_i : U_i \to \mathbb{R}^2$  and  $\psi_i : V_i \to \mathbb{R}^2$  by

$$\phi_i(y_1, y_2, y_3) = -\psi_i(y_1, y_2, y_3) = \left(\frac{y_m}{y_i}, \frac{y_n}{y_i}\right),$$

where  $m \neq i, n \neq i$  and  $m < n$ . Denoting by  $(u, v)$  the image of  $\phi_i$  and  $\psi_i$  in every chart (therefore  $(u, v)$  play different roles in each chart) one can see the following expressions for  $p(X)$ :

$$v^{n} \ m(u,v) \left( Q\left(\frac{1}{v}, \frac{u}{v}\right) - uP\left(\frac{1}{v}, \frac{u}{v}\right), -vP\left(\frac{1}{v}, \frac{u}{v}\right) \right) \text{ in } U_{1},$$
$$v^{n} \ m(u,v) \left( P\left(\frac{u}{v}, \frac{1}{v}\right) - uQ\left(\frac{u}{v}, \frac{1}{v}\right), -vQ\left(\frac{u}{v}, \frac{1}{v}\right) \right) \text{ in } U_{2},$$
$$m(u,v)(P(u,v), Q(u,v)) \text{ in } U_{3},$$

where  $m(u,v) = (u^2 + v^2 + 1)^{-\frac{1}{2}(n-1)}$ . We can omit the term  $m(u,v)$  by a time rescaling of  $p(X)$ . Therefore, we obtain a polynomial expression of  $p(X)$  in each  $U_i$ . The expressions of  $p(X)$  in each  $V_i$  is the same as that for each  $U_i$ , except by a multiplicative factor of  $(-1)^{n-1}$ . In these coordinates for  $i \in \{1, 2\}, v = 0$  always represents the points of  $\mathbb{S}^1$  and thus the infinity of  $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Note that  $\mathbb{S}^1$  is invariant under the flow of  $p(X)$ .
