*Proof.* Let  $g \in \Lambda$  have a non-trivial projection on  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}}$ , and let  $z \in \Lambda \cap Z$ . We have  $g^k z q^{-k} =$  $a^{k}(z)$ , where  $a = r(g)$ . Since the actions of  $\mathbb{R}_{L}$  and K on the center of Heis are trivial, and the action of  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}}$  is contracting (up to forward or backward iteration), it follows that the sequence  $(a^k(z))_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}$  has an accumulation point at 1. As  $\Lambda$  is discrete, the set  $\{a^k(z), k\in\mathbb{N}\}\subset\Lambda$ must be finite, which forces  $z = 1$ .  $\Box$ 

**Lemma 3.7.** ([17, Lemma 5.3]) Let Q be the semi-direct product  $Q = \mathbb{R} \ltimes C$  where C is a compact connected Lie group. Then Q is isomorphic to the product  $\mathbb{R} \times C$ .

The last lemma we will need in this section is Lemma  $3.8$  below. It is similar to [16, Proposition 5.4, but we present it here in a form that allows for systematic application. The proof however is the same, so to avoid unnecessary lengthening of the paper, we will not rewrite the proof.

Let  $Q \ltimes C \subset \text{Aut}(\text{Heis})$  preserving the decomposition  $\mathfrak{heis} = \mathfrak{a} \oplus \mathfrak{z}$ , and such that C is compact. Define

$$G := (Q \ltimes C) \ltimes N.$$

Let  $\Gamma$  be a discrete subgroup of G. Under some conditions, the proposition below ensures the existence of a nilpotent syndetic hull of  $\Gamma$ , i.e. a connected nilpotent subgroup of G containing  $\Gamma$  as a lattice.

**Lemma 3.8.** Let  $\Gamma$  be a discrete subgroup of  $G$ , whose projection on  $Q$  is dense. Then, up to finite index,  $\Gamma$  is a lattice in a connected closed nilpotent subgroup of G.

3.2. **Proof of Theorem 3.1.** We will examine all possible closures of the projection of  $\Gamma$ to  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}} \times \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{L}} \simeq \mathbb{R}^2$ .

**Proposition 3.9.** If  $\overline{p(\Gamma)} = \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}} \times \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{L}}$ , then  $\Gamma$  does not act properly discontinuously and  $cocompactly\ on\ X.$ 

*Proof.* By Lemma 3.8,  $\Gamma$  is a cocompact lattice in a connected nilpotent subgroup N of G. We will show that  $N \cap \text{Heis} \neq \{1\}$ . Our claim is that  $\dim N \geq n+2$ . Indeed,  $\Gamma$  acts properly and cocompactly on the  $K(\pi, 1)$  space  $N/C \simeq \mathbb{R}^k$ , where C is the maximal compact subgroup of N. So its cohomological dimension is equal to  $\dim(N/C)$ . On the other hand, since  $\Gamma$  also acts properly and cocompactly on  $X = \mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ , its cohomological dimension must be  $n+2$ . This implies that dim  $N/C = n+2$ . Now, decompose N as  $N = \mathbb{R} \ltimes N_1$ , where the  $\mathbb{R}$ -factor is generated by a one-parameter subgroup of G with a nontrivial projection on  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{L}}$ , and where

$$N_1 := N \cap (\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}} \times K) \ltimes \mathsf{Heis},$$

satisfies dim  $N_1 \geq n+1$ . We have  $p_{\mathbf{H}}(N_1) = \mathbb{R}$ , so we further decompose  $N_1$  as  $N_1 = \mathbb{R} \ltimes N_0$ , where the  $\mathbb{R}$ -factor is a one-parameter subgroup  $s(t)$  of  $(\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}} \times K) \ltimes \mathsf{Heis}$  that has a nontrivial projection on  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}}$ , and

$$N_0 := N_1 \cap (K \ltimes \mathsf{Heis}),$$

with dim  $N_0 \geq n$ . Since  $N_0$  is nilpotent, its projection to K is an abelian subgroup of  $O(n)$ , whose maximal possible dimension is  $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ . Consequently,  $N_0$  must intersect Heis nontrivially. Moreover,  $N_1$  contains the subgroup  $s(t) \ltimes (N_0 \cap \mathsf{Heis})$ , which is therefore nilpotent. However, since the action of  $s(t)$  on  $N_0 \cap$  Heis is semisimple (and unipotent), it must be trivial. This is impossible since  $s(t)$  projects non-trivially on  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}}$ , so its real eigenvalues are all different from 1 (the real eigenvalues of its projection to  $K$  are all equal to 1).  $\Box$ 

**Proposition 3.10.** If  $\overline{p(\Gamma)} = \mathbb{R}$ , the action of  $\Gamma$  is properly discontinuous and cocompact if and only if  $\Gamma$  is contained in the isometry group.

*Proof.* We have a short exact sequence  $1 \to K \ltimes \mathsf{Heis} \to G \to \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{L}} \times \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{H}} \to 1$ . Let  $\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{T}} =$  $\{e^{tT}, t \in \mathbb{R}\}\$  be a one-parameter subgroup of G such that  $p(\mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{T}}) = \overline{p(\Gamma)}$ . Then,  $\Gamma$  is contained in  $G_1 := \mathbb{R}_{\mathbf{T}} \ltimes (K \ltimes \mathsf{Heis}).$ 

We will show that this group is, in fact, isomorphic to a group of the form  $(\mathbb{R} \times K) \ltimes \mathsf{Heis}$ . Write  $\mathbf{T} = \lambda + \Phi + \omega$ , with  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}H \oplus \mathbb{R}L$ ,  $\Phi \in \mathfrak{k}$ , and  $\omega \in \mathfrak{heis}$ . For any  $\Psi \in \mathfrak{k}$ , we have

$$[\mathbf{T}, \Psi] = [\Phi, \Psi] + [\omega, \Psi] \in \mathfrak{k} \ltimes \mathfrak{heis}.$$
