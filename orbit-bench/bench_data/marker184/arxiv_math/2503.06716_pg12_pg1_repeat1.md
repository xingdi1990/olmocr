We are now ready to present the proof of the Bianchi-Egnell type stability for the fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality  $(1.1)$ .

**Proof of Theorem 1.3.** Clearly the sharpness of the result follows from the Lemma  $3.2$  above.

Suppose that the theorem is not true. Then we can find a sequence  $(u_k)_{k\geq 1}$  in  $\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$  such that

$$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\|u_k\|_{\dot{H}^s}^2 - \mu_{s,t} \|\|x\|^{\frac{2}{2^*_s(t)}} u_k\|_{2^*_s(t)}^2}{d(u_k, \mathcal{M})^2} = 0 \tag{3.8}$$

Since the ratio in (3.8) is homogeneous of degree 2 in  $u_k$ , we may also suppose that  $||u_k||^2_{\dot{H}^s} = \mu_{s,t}$  for all  $k \ge 1$ . Moreover,  $0 \in \mathcal{M}$  implies that  $d(u_k, \mathcal{M}) \le d(u_k, 0) = \|u_k\|_{\dot{H}^s} = \sqrt{\mu_{s,t}} < \infty$ . Thus, up to a subsequence still denoted by  $u_k$ , we see that  $d(u_k, \mathcal{M}) \to L \in [0, \sqrt{\mu_{s,t}}]$ .

We now consider two cases, specifically  $L = 0$  and  $L > 0$ .

When  $L = 0 < \sqrt{\mu_{s,t}}$ ; we can assume (if required up to a further subsequence still denoted by  $u_k$ ) that for all  $k \ge 1$  one has  $d(u_k, \mathcal{M}) < \sqrt{\mu_{s,t}} = \|u_k\|_{\dot{H}^s}$ . Lemma 3.1 now gives that the above ratio is greater than or equal to  $\alpha + o(1) \rightarrow \alpha > 0$  as  $k \rightarrow \infty$  and it's a contradiction to (3.8).

Thus  $L>0$  and then we must have that the numerator of the above ratio goes to 0 as  $k\to\infty$ , this in turn satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma  $3.3$ . Consequently, we obtain

$$L = \lim_{k \to \infty} d(u_k, \mathcal{M}) \le \lim_{k \to \infty} \|u_k - U_{s,t}^{\lambda_k}\|_{\dot{H}^s} = 0$$

and this gives us the desired contradiction.

## 4. Palais-Smale decomposition

Although the energy functional associated with our problem  $(1.3)$  is given as in  $(3.7)$ , for purely technical reasons, we consider the following normalized functional

$$I_{s,t}(u) \coloneqq \frac{1}{2} \|u\|_{\dot{H}^s}^2 - \frac{1}{2_s^*(t)} \left\| |x|^{-\frac{t}{2_s^*(t)}} u \right\|_{2_s^*(t)}^{2_s^*(t)}. \tag{4.1}$$

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the critical points of  $(4.1)$  and the critical points of  $(3.7)$ . Specifically, one has that  $u \in \dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$  is a weak solution to (1.3) (i.e., a critical point of (3.7)) if and only if  $\mu_{s,t}^{\frac{1}{2_s^*(t)-2}}u$  is a weak solution to the normalized Euler-Lagrange equation

$$\begin{cases}\n(-\Delta)^s u = \frac{|u|^{2^*_s(t)-2}u}{|x|^t} \quad ; u \in \dot{H}^s\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right) \\
u > 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N\n\end{cases} \tag{4.2}$$

(i.e., a critical point of  $(4.1)$ ). Due to this one-one correspondence, all the crucial properties of the energy functional are unchanged, therefore we only analyze the normalized functional moving onward.

**Definition 4.1.** We say that the sequence  $(u_n)_{n\geq 1} \subset \dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$  is a Palais-Smale sequence for  $I_{s,t}$  at level  $\beta$  $((PS)_{\beta} \text{ condition in-short}), \text{ if } I_{s,t}(u_n) \to \beta \text{ and } (I_{s,t})'(u_n) \to 0 \text{ in } (\dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^N))' \text{ as } n \to \infty. \text{ The functional } I_{s,t}$ is said to satisfy  $(PS)_{\beta}$  condition if every  $(PS)_{\beta}$  sequence has a convergent subsequence in  $\dot{H}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$ .

It is easy to see that the weak limit of a  $(PS)$  sequence solves  $(4.2)$  except for the positivity. However, the main difficulty is that the  $(PS)$  sequence may not converge strongly and the weak limit can be zero even if  $\beta > 0$ . The content of this section is the classification of  $(PS)$  sequences of the functional  $I_{s,t}$  which is given in the next proposition and the proof follows by arguments analogous to  $[4, \text{Theorem 2.1}].$ 

**Proposition 4.2.** Let  $(u_n)_{n\geq 1} \subset \dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$  be a Palais-Smale sequence for  $I_{s,t}$  at level  $\beta$ . Then up to a subsequence (still denoted by  $u_n$ ) the following properties hold:
