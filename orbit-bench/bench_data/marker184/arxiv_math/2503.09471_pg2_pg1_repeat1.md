1)  $\Omega(t,t) = \text{id}, \Omega(t,t_0) = \Omega(t,s)\Omega(s,t_0)$  for all  $t, s, t_0 \in [\tau,\infty);$ 2) and for almost all *t*,*s* âˆˆ  $[\tau, \infty)$  it holds that

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Omega(t,s) &= A(t) \Omega(t,s), \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \Omega(t,s) &= -A(s) \Omega(t,s). \end{aligned} \tag{3}$$

A non-empty, closed, convex subset  $K \subset \mathcal{H}$  is called a cone, if  $\mathbb{R}_+ K \subset K$  and  $K \cap (-K) = \{0\}$  hold. A cone K is called generating if any  $x \in \mathscr{H}$  can be written as  $x = x^+ - x^$ for some  $x^{\pm} \in K$ . In a Hilbert space any generating cone is nonflat, that is there exists a constant  $a_K > 0$ , independent on x, such that in the representation  $x = x^+ - x^-$  the vectors  $x^{\pm}$  can be chosen so that

$$\|x^{\pm}\| \le a_K \|x\|. \tag{4}$$

The set  $K^* = \{f \in L(\mathcal{H}; \mathbb{R}) : f(K) \subset \mathbb{R}_+\} \subset \mathcal{H}^* = \mathcal{H}$  is called adjoint cone. If K is generating, then  $K^*$  is normal, i.e., there is a constant  $b_K > 0$  such that  $x \in K$ ,  $y - x \in K$  imply  $||x|| \le b_K ||y||$ . A cone K is called selfadjoint if  $K^* = K$ . In a Hilbert space any selfadjoint cone is normal [13].

*Definition 1:* Let  $K$  be a generating and selfadjoint cone in  $\mathcal{H}$ . System (1) is called Wazewski [14] with respect to K (also called monotone [15]) if its evolution operator  $\Omega$ satisfies  $\Omega(t,s)K \subset K$  for all  $t > s > \tau$ .

Definition 2: We say that  $(1)$  is stable in  $K$  if for any  $\varepsilon > 0$  and any  $t_0 \geq \tau$  there is a  $\delta = \delta(\varepsilon, t_0) > 0$  such that  $x_0 \in B_\delta \cap K \Longrightarrow ||x(t;t_0,x_0)|| < \varepsilon, t \ge t_0; \text{ if, in addition, the } \delta$ can be chosen independent on  $t_0$ , then (1) is called uniformly stable in  $K$ ;

asymptotically stable in  $K$  if it is stable in  $K$  and there is  $\eta = \eta(t_0) > 0$  such that  $x_0 \in B_{\eta} \cap K \implies$  $\lim_{t\to\infty}||x(t;t_0,x_0)||=0$ ; if, in addition,  $\eta$  can be chosen independent on  $t_0$ , then (1) is called uniformly asymptotically stable in  $K$ .

If any of the above properties holds with  $\mathscr{H}$  on the place of  $K$ , then we drop "in  $K$ " in their definitions.

Let system  $(1)$  be decomposed in two subsystems as follows

$$\dot{x}_i = A_{ii}(t)x_i + A_{ij}(t)x_j, \quad i \neq j, \quad i, j = 1, 2, \tag{5}$$

with  $x_i \in \mathcal{H}_i$ ,  $A_{ij} \in L(H_i, H_i)$  for  $i, j = 1, 2$ . Let  $K_i$  be a solid selfadjoint cone in  $\mathscr{H}_i$ , then  $K = K_1 \bigoplus K_2$  is a solid and selfadjoint cone in  $\mathcal{H}$ .

Let  $\Omega_i \in C([\tau,\infty) \times [\tau,\infty); L(\mathscr{H}_i))$  denote the evolution operator of the decoupled subsystem

$$\dot{y}_i = A_{ii}(t)y_i, \quad y_i \in \mathcal{H}_i, \quad i = 1, 2 \n$$
(6)

It can be verified by definition that  $(1)$ , written as  $(5)$ , is a Wazewski system for the cone  $K$ , if and only if

$$\Omega_i(t,s)K_i \subset K_i \quad \text{and} \quad A_{ij}(t)K_j \subset K_i, \quad t \ge s \ge \tau. \tag{7}$$

*Definition 3:* An operator  $O \in L(\mathcal{H}_i; \mathcal{H}_i)$  is called positive, if it satisfies  $OK_i \subset K_i$  and it is denoted by  $O \geq 0$ . For the evolution operator  $\Omega_i$  of (6) let  $\alpha_i$ ,  $\beta_i$ ,  $\gamma_i$ ,  $\delta_i \in$  $C([\tau,\infty);\mathbb{R}_{>0})$  be such that

$$\|\Omega_i(t,s)\| \le \alpha_i(t)\beta_i(s), \quad t \ge s \ge \tau, |\Omega_i(t,s)\| \le (\gamma_i(t))^{-1}(\delta_i(s))^{-1}, \quad s \ge t \ge \tau,$$
 (8)

for example we can fix any  $p \in (s,t)$  and take  $\alpha_i(t) = \|\Omega_i(t,p)\|, \ \beta_i(s) = \|\Omega_i(p,s)\|$  due to  $\Omega_i(t,s) =$  $\Omega_i(t,p)\Omega_i(p,s)$ .

Let  $q_i \in C([\tau,\infty); \mathbb{R}_{>0})$  be suitable weight functions guaranteeing convergence of the next integrals for  $t \in [\tau, \infty)$ 

$$\begin{aligned}\n\phi_i(t) &:= \gamma_i^2(t) \int\limits_t^\infty q_i(s) \delta_i^2(s) \, ds, \\
g_i(t) &:= \beta_i^2(t) \int\limits_t^\infty q_i(s) \alpha_i^2(s) \, ds.\n\end{aligned} \tag{9}$$

## III. MAIN RESULTS

For simplicity and clearness in this work we consider the case of  $r = 2$  interconnected subsystems in (5). An extension for  $r \in \mathbb{N}$  will developed elsewhere. We introduce the following notation for  $1 \le i \ne j \le 2$ : linear weighted integral gains for the interconnection  $(5)$  are defined as

$$\pi_{ii}(t_0) = 2 \sup_{t \ge t_0} \omega_i(t) \beta_i^2(t)$$
$$\times \int_t^\infty \alpha_i(s) \|A_{ji}(s)\| \beta_j(s) \int_s^\infty \frac{\alpha_i(p)\alpha_j(p) \|A_{ij}(p)\|}{\omega_i(p)} dp ds, \tag{10}$$

$$\times \int_{t}^{\infty} \alpha_{i}(s) \|A_{ji}(s)\| \beta_{j}(s) \int_{s}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha_{i}(p)\alpha_{j}(p)\|A_{ji}(p)\|}{\omega_{j}(p)} dp ds, \tag{11}$$

where  $\omega_i$  are suitable weight functions, which can help to enable convergence of the integrals. Also for  $f \in$  $C([t_0,T];L(\mathscr{H}_i))$  we introduce the weighted norm

$$\|f\|_{\omega_{t},T} := \max_{t \in [t_{0},T]} \omega_{i}(t) \|f(t)\|.$$

*Theorem 1:* Let  $(1)$  be a Wazewski system with respect to a selfadjoint solid cone K and written as (5) with  $r = 2$ . Let  $\alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i, \delta_i$  be as in (8) and  $\phi_i, g_i, q_i, \omega_i, \pi_{ij}$  as in (9),(10),(11). If the spectral radius of the matrix  $\Pi(t_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$  defined by the weighted integral gains  $\pi_{ij}(t_0)$  satisfies

$$r_{\sigma}(\Pi(t_0)) < 1 \tag{13}$$

then solutions to  $(1)$  satisfy the estimate

$$\|x(t;t_0,x_0)\| \le 2a_K \sqrt{\frac{h(t_0,t_0)}{\phi(t)}} \exp\Big(-\int_{t_0}^t \frac{q(s)}{2h(s,t_0)} ds\Big) \|x_0\|, \tag{14}$$

where  $a_K$  is from (4),  $q(t) := \min\{q_1(t), q_2(t)\},\$  $\phi(t) := \min\{\phi_1(t), \phi_2(t)\}\$ and  $h(t, t_0) := \max\{h_{11}(t, t_0) +$
