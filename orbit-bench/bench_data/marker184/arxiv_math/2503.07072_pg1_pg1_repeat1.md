## $\text{Abstract}$

The problem of determining the maximum number of copies of T in an  $H$ -free graph, for any graphs  $T$  and  $H$ , was considered by Alon and Shikhelman. This is a variant of Turán's classical extremal problem. We show lower and upper bounds for the maximum number of  $s$ -cliques in a graph with no disjoint copies of arbitrary graph. We also determine the maximum number of s-cliques in an  $n$ -vertex graph that does not contain a disjoint union of k paths of length two when  $k = 2, 3$ , or  $s \ge k + 2$ , or  $n$  is sufficiently large, this partly confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang  $[1]$ .

## 1. Introduction

A graph  $G$  is said to be  $H$ -free if it does not contain any subgraph isomorphic to H. The classical extremal function  $ex(n, H)$  denoted as  $ex(n, H)$ , is formally defined as the maximum number of edges on an  $n$ -vertex  $H$ -free graph. This function extends naturally to a scenario where the objective is not merely to maximize the number of edges, but rather to maximize the number of copies of a specified graph  $T$  within an *n*-vertex graph that is  $H$ -free. In accordance with the notation introduced by Alon and Shikhelman [2], the more general function is denoted as  $\text{ex}(n, T, H)$ , which is commonly referred to the generalized Turán number of H. Let  $P_k$  be the path with k vertices. Obviously,  $\text{ex}(n, P_2, H) = \text{ex}(n, H)$ . We denote the cycle with  $\ell$  vertices by  $C_{\ell}$  and the complete graph with s vertices by  $K_s$ .

The exploration of such problems dates back to the foundational work of Erdős [3], who established the values of  $\text{ex}(n, K_s, K_t)$  for any two cliques. After these seminal discoveries, a series of related findings were made, with one of the most notable being the resolution of  $\text{ex}(n, C_5, C_3)$  by Hatami et al. [4], and Grzesik [5], each working independently. A wealth of additional research has further expanded our understanding of generalized extremal numbers, as evidenced by various studies referenced in the literature  $[6, 7, 8, 9]$ .

Scholars have studied the generalized Turán numbers for the vertex-disjoint union of graphs. Let  $kH$  represent the collection of k disjoint copies of the graph H. Gerbner, Methuku, and Vizer [10] delved into the function  $\text{ex}(n, T, kH)$ , where H
