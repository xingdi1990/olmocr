We point out that there are no conditions on spaces and maps, except normality, making the theorem as broad as possible.

*Proof.* We keep the same data as in Lemma 34, so  $\text{liftcat}_f^{\text{op}}(h) = \text{liftcat}_{j \circ f}^{\text{op}}(\mu)$ . On the other hand, Proposition 12 shows that  $\text{liftcat}_{j \circ f}(\mu) = \text{liftcat}_f(h)$ . So we can work with  $\mu$  and  $f' = j \circ f$  rather than with  $h$  and  $f$ .

By definition, liftcat<sub>f'</sub>  $(\mu) \leq n$  if and only if there exists a map  $\Phi \colon X \to T^n(\mu)$ making the following diagram homotopy commutative:

From Remark 6, we regard the cofibrations  $\mu$  and  $t_n$  as inclusions and consider that  $T^n(\mu) = \bigcup_{i=0}^n p_i^{-1}(A) \subseteq Z_h^{n+1}$  where  $p_i$  is the *i*-th projection  $p_i \colon Z_h^{n+1} \to Z_h$ .

Assume we have the map  $\Phi$  and the homotopy  $H: X \times I \to Z_h^{n+1}$  between  $\Delta_{n+1} \circ f'$  and  $t_n \circ \Phi$ .

Consider the open neighborhood  $\mathcal{N}$  of  $A$  in  $Z_h$  which is deformable in  $Z_h$  into  $A$ with some homotopy G rel A. For  $0 \leq i \leq n$ , let  $h_i = p_i \circ t_n \circ \Phi$  and  $U_i = h_i^{-1}(\mathcal{N})$ . As  $(t_n \circ \Phi)(X) \subseteq T^n(\mu) = \bigcup_{i=0}^n p_i^{-1}(A)$ , we have  $X = \bigcup_{i=0}^n U_i$ .

Now we can define homotopies  $L_i: U_i \times I \to Z_h$  by:

$$L_i(u,t) = \begin{cases} p_i(H(u,2t)) & \text{if } 0 \le t \le \frac{1}{2} \\ G(h_i(u), 2t - 1) & \text{if } \frac{1}{2} \le t \le 1. \end{cases}$$

Each  $L_i$  is well defined because  $p_i(H(u, 1)) = p_i((t_n \circ \Phi)(u)) = h_i(u) = G(h_i(u), 0).$ We have  $L_i(u,0) = f'(u)$  and  $L_i(u,1) \in A$ , so  $L_i$  is a homotopy between  $f'|_{U_i}$  and  $\mu \circ l_i$  where  $l_i = L_i(-, 1)$ .

Conversely assume we have an open cover  $(U_i)_{0 \le i \le n}$  of X and homotopies  $K_i: U_i \times I \to Z_h$  with  $K_i(u,0) = f'(u)$  and  $K_i(u,1) \in A$ . Choose a closed subset  $F_i \subset U_i$  (possibly the empty set) in each  $U_i$ . If X is normal, we have two more open covers  $(V_i)_{0 \le i \le n}$  and  $(W_i)_{0 \le i \le n}$  of X such that

$$F_i \subset W_i \subset \overline{W_i} \subset V_i \subset \overline{V_i} \subset U_i.$$

Moreover, as  $\overline{W_i}$  and  $\complement V_i = X \setminus V_i$  are disjoint closed subspaces of the normal space  $X$ , we have an Urysohn map  $\varphi_i \colon X \to I$  with  $\varphi_i(\overline{W_i}) = 1$  and  $\varphi_i(\complement V_i) = 0$ .

Now we define  $H_i: X \times I \to Z_h$  by:

$$H_i(x,t) = \begin{cases} f'(x) & \text{if } x \in \complement \overline{V_i} \\ K_i(x, t\varphi_i(x)) & \text{if } x \in U_i. \end{cases}$$

Each  $H_i$  is well defined because if  $x \in \complement \overline{V_i} \cap U_i$ , then  $K_i(x, t\varphi_i(x)) = K_i(x, 0) =$  $f'(x)$ .

Let  $H = (H_0, \ldots, H_n) \colon X \times I \to Z_h^{n+1}$  and  $\Phi = H(-, 1)$ . We have  $H(-, 0) = \Delta_{n+1} \circ f'$ . On the other hand, for any  $x \in X$ , there is (at least) one i such that  $x \in W_i$ , so  $\varphi_i(x) = 1$  and  $H_i(x, 1) = K_i(x, 1) \in A$ ; this means that  $\Phi(X) \subseteq T^n(\mu)$ . Thus *H* is a homotopy between  $\Delta_{n+1} \circ f'$  and  $t_n \circ \Phi$ .  $\Box$
