Some key theoretical results behind the Gröbner walk are stated below. Detailed proofs and additional context may be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of  $[10]$ .

**Theorem 2.** For an ideal  $I \triangleleft R$ , the following sets are in one-to-one correspondence:

$$\begin{cases}\n\text{in}_{<}(I), \\
< \text{is a term order}\n\end{cases} \leftrightarrow \begin{cases}\n\text{marked } \text{Gr\"obner bases} \\
\text{of } I\n\end{cases} \leftrightarrow \begin{cases}\n\text{full-dimensional} \\
\text{cones of } \mathbb{G}(I)\n\end{cases}$$

In our setting, a *marked* Gröbner basis is a reduced Gröbner basis with the leading terms identified (formally, each g is encoded as a pair  $(g, x^{\alpha})$ , where  $x^{\alpha} = \text{in}_{<}(g)$ ). The first correspondence in Theorem 2 immediate, whilst the second correspondence is a consequence of  $[13,$ Theorem 1.11: marked Gröbner bases encode the defining integer vectors of an H-description of the corresponding cone.

Lower-dimensional cones in  $\mathbb{G}(I)$  correspond to generalized initial ideals  $\text{in}_{\omega}(I)$ , where  $\omega$  is any weight vector in the relative interior of said cone. Generically, such ideals are "almost monomial", and may be retrieved with the help of the following lemma:

**Lemma 3.** Let  $G_{\leq}$  be a marked Gröbner basis of  $I$  with regards to  $\leq$  and  $\omega \in \mathbb{R}^n_{\geq 0}$  be a weight vector on the boundary of the corresponding cone in  $\mathbb{G}(I)$ . The set

$$\operatorname{in}_{\omega}(G_{<}) = \{\operatorname{in}_{\omega}(g), g \in G_{<}\}\$$

is a marked Gröbner basis of  $\text{in}_{\omega}(I)$  with respect to <.

At every step of the Gröbner walk, a basis of this form converted with Buchberger's algorithm and then lifted to the basis of  $I$  corresponding to the adjacent full-dimensional cone, which corresponds to  $(<_t)_{\omega}$ , i.e. the refinement of the target ordering  $<_t$  by  $\omega$ .

**Lemma 4.** Let  $M = \{m_1, ..., m_r\}$  be the marked Gröbner basis of  $\text{in}_{\omega}(I)$  with respect to the refinement ordering  $(<_t)_{\omega}$ . Then

$$G := \{m_1 - \overline{m_1}^{G_<}, ..., m_r - \overline{m_r}^{G_<}\}$$

is a Gröbner basis of I with respect to  $(<_t)_\omega$  where  $\overline{f}^{G_<}$  denotes the normal form of f with respect to the basis  $G_{<}$ .

This process of subsequent passing to the generalized initial ideal and lifting to the adjacent basis is repeated until the target basis is computed.

## 3. Functionality

Our implementation of the Gröbner walk ships with OSCAR since version 1.2.0, thus it suffices to load OSCAR. There is a straightforward interface through the function groebner\_walk.

**Example 5.** Continuing from example Example 1, we can calculate a Gröbner basis of the ideal

$$I = \langle y^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x, x^4 \rangle \triangleleft \mathbb{Q}[x, y]$$

with respect to  $\leq_{\text{lex}}$  by starting from a Gröbner basis for the graded reverse lexicographic order $ing <_{\text{degree}}.$  Since  $<_{\text{degree}}.$  is the default internal ordering of any polynomial ring in OSCAR, it suffices to call the Gröbner walk in the following way.
