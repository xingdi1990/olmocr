Before turning to the proof of Theorem  $3.15$ , we gather a few facts relating hyperplanes and relative contact complexes.

**Proposition 3.17.** Let X be a quasi-median graph and  $\mathbb{G}$  be a collection of gated subgraphs. For a finite collection of hyperplanes  $\mathcal{J}$  of X, the following statements are  $equivalent:$ 

- $\mathcal{J}$  is a simplex of  $\mathrm{Cont}^{\triangle}(X,\mathbb{G})$ :
- there exists  $Y \in \mathbb{G}$  and  $x \in Y \cap \bigcap_{J \in \mathcal{J}} N(J)$  such that Y contains the clique of J containing x for each  $J \in \mathcal{J}$ .

Moreover, if  $\mathbb{G}$  is a star-covering collection of gated subgraphs, the above statements are  $equivalent\ to:$ 

â€¢ for every  $x \in \bigcap_{J \in \mathcal{J}} N(J)$ , there exists  $Y \in \mathbb{G}$  that contains the clique of  $J$  con $taining x for each J \in \mathcal{J}.$ 

*Proof.* Suppose  $\mathcal{J} = \{J_1, \ldots, J_n\}$  is a simplex of  $\mathrm{Cont}^{\triangle}(X, \mathbb{G})$ . Then there exists  $Y \in$  $\mathbb{G}$  such that  $\{N(J_1), \ldots, N(J_n)\} \cup \{Y\}$  is a collection of pairwise intersecting gated subgraphs, and the Helly property implies that  $Y \cap \bigcap_{i=1}^n N(J_i)$  is non-empty. Let  $x \in$  $Y \cap \bigcap_{i=1}^n N(J_i)$ . Since  $J_i$  crosses Y, the clique of  $J_i$  containing x is contained in Y by Corollary 2.6. That the second and third statements imply the first one follows directly from the definitions.

Let us prove that the first statement implies the third one assuming that  $\mathbb{G}$  is starcovering. Let  $\mathcal{J} = \{J_1, \ldots, J_n\}$  be a simplex of  $\mathrm{Cont}^{\triangle}(X, \mathbb{G})$  and  $x \in \bigcap_{J \in \mathcal{J}} N(J)$ . The hyperplanes in  $\mathcal{J}$  are pairwise in contact, and there exists  $Z \in \mathbb{G}$  such that each  $J \in \mathcal{J}$  crosses Z. If  $x \in Z \cap \bigcap_{i=1}^n N(J)$ , then Corollary 2.6 implies that the clique of J containing x is contained in Z for each  $J \in \mathcal{J}$ ; in this case, it suffices to set  $Y := Z$ . Suppose that  $x \notin Z \cap \bigcap_{i=1}^n N(J_i)$  and let J be a hyperplane separating x from Z, which we can choose to be tangent to x. Let C be the clique of J containing x. Since  $\mathbb{G}$  is star-covering, there exists  $Y \in \mathbb{G}$  containing all the prisms that contain C. For every  $1 \leq i \leq n$ , let  $C_i$  be the clique of  $J_i$  containing x. Since J is necessarily transverse to  $J_i$ , Proposition 2.10 implies that C and  $C_i$  span a prism containing x, and hence  $C_i$  is contained in  $Y$ .  $\Box$ 

The rest of the section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem  $3.15$ . We fix a quasi-median graph X and a collection  $\mathbb{G}$  of gated subgraphs. The equivalence of the two statements of Theorem 3.15 will be proven in Lemma 3.20 by showing that for each vertex  $x \in X$ ,  $\mathrm{sL}_{\mathbb{G}}(x)$  is homotopy equivalent to  $\mathrm{L}_{\mathbb{G}}(x)$ .

Let  $X^{\odot}$  be the *perforation* of X, i.e. the space obtained from the prism-completion  $X^{\square}$ of X by removing a small open ball around each vertex of a fixed radius  $\epsilon < 1/2$ , if we endow  $X^{\square}$  with a length metric that extends the Euclidean metrics on its prisms. Given a vertex  $x \in X$ , the sphere  $S(x,\epsilon)$  can be identified with the link of x in the prismcompletion  $X^{\Box}$ . In other words, we can think of  $S(x,\epsilon)$  as the simplicial complex whose vertices are the edges of  $X$  containing  $x$  and whose simplices are given by collections of edges contained in a common prism of  $X$ .

When G is prism-covering, the complex  $L_{G}(x)$  naturally contains  $S(x,\epsilon)$  as a subcomplex, which allows us to define

$$X^{\mathbb{G}} := X^{\odot} \cup \bigcup_{x \in X} \mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{G}}(x)$$

where each  $L_{\mathbb{G}}(x)$  is glued to  $X^{\odot}$  over  $S(x,\epsilon)$ .
