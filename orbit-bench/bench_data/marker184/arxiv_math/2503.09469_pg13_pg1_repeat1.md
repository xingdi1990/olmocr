therefore,  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B}-\omega_0\mathcal{C}') = \langle \mathbf{V}_1(\mathcal{B}), (\mathcal{B}-\omega_0\mathcal{C}') \left( \mathbf{V}_1(\mathcal{B}) \right) \rangle = 2\mu_1 - \omega_0 \xi$  since  $\mathcal{C}' \in \mathfrak{C}$ . So the strict inequality is asserting that  $2\mu_1 - \omega_0 \xi < \lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}^*)$ . However, the arguments in Lemmas 4 and 5, that apply to  $\mathcal{C}^*$  (since  $\mathcal{C}^* \in \mathfrak{C}$ ), show that  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega \mathcal{C}^*)$  is a concave function of  $\omega$  and that the linear function  $2\mu_1 - \omega\xi$  is an upper bound for it. This violates the strict inequality in:  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0\mathcal{C}') = 2\mu_1 - \omega_0\xi < 0$  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}^*) \le 2\mu_1 - \omega_0 \xi.$ 

Let S denote the two dimensional subspace spanned by  $V_1(\mathcal{B})$  and  $V$  and  $\mathcal{C}'_S$  denote the restriction of  $\mathcal{C}'$  to this subspace (i.e.,  $\mathcal{C}'_S$  agrees with  $\mathcal{C}'$  for any vector in this subspace and assigns 0 to any element outside). Also  $V_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}') \in S$  by the definition of  $V$  and  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}'_S) = \lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}')$ .

Since  $\mathcal{C}' \in \mathfrak{C}$ , its restriction to S satisfies  $\langle \mathbf{V}_1(\mathcal{B}), \mathcal{C}'_S(\mathbf{V}_1(\mathcal{B})) \rangle = \xi$ . Also,  $\mathcal{C}'_S \preccurlyeq \mathcal{B}/2$  since  $\mathcal{C}' \preccurlyeq \mathcal{B}/2$ . To satisfy the kissing constraint in Properties 2, we can add a component along  $V: \mathcal{C}_S'' := \mathcal{C}_S' + \delta V \otimes V \in \mathfrak{C}$ for some  $\delta \geq 0$ . Since  $\mathcal{C}_S'' \succcurlyeq \mathcal{C}_S'$  we have  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}_S'') \leq \lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega_0 \mathcal{C}_S')$ . Proposition 3 establishes  $\mathcal{C}^* \uparrow \mathcal{C}_S''$ , a relationship that applies to all  $\omega \in [0, 2]$ , that guarantees:

$$\lambda_1(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}-\omega_0\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}^\star) \leq \lambda_1(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}-\omega_0\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_S'') \leq \lambda_1(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}-\omega_0\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_S').$$

This is in contradiction with the strict inequality  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B}-\omega_0\mathcal{C}^*) > \lambda_1(\mathcal{B}-\omega_0\mathcal{C}')$ .

Proof of Theorem 1. Theorem 2 implies  $\lambda_1(\mathcal{B}^* - \omega \mathcal{C}^*) = \lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega \mathcal{C}^*) \leq \lambda_1(\mathcal{B} - \omega \mathcal{C})$  for  $\omega \in [0, 2]$  that establishes  $C(\omega) \geq \lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{A}(\omega))$  based on (14). The covariance  $\Sigma_k$  converges to **0** according to the rate given by  $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{A}(\omega))$  and the expected error at each step is the trace of  $\Sigma_k$ :  $\mathbb{E}\left[\|\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_k\|^2\right] = \text{tr}\,\Sigma_k$ . When i is drawn independently and identically distributed at each step of  $(1)$ , the geometric rate of convergence is bound by  $C(\omega)$  for every  $\omega \in [0, 2]$ .  $\Box$ 

## Perron-Frobenius Theory For Positive Linear Maps $4.4$

The superoperator  $\mathcal{A}$  defined in (7) plays the role of the iteration matrix — whose spectrum provides convergence analysis in classical iterative methods [Saad,  $2003$ ] — for randomized iterations. In this section we discuss the theoretical foundations that provide necessary properties on the spectrum of  $\mathcal{A}$  in the covariance analysis we have seen.

Recall the superoperator  $\mathcal{A}$ , for a fixed  $\omega$ , denotes a linear map over the space of  $n \times n$  matrices as:

$$\mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{X}) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\boldsymbol{I} - \omega \boldsymbol{P}_i) \boldsymbol{X} (\boldsymbol{I} - \omega \boldsymbol{P}_i).$$

Since orthogonal projection is a symmetric operator, for any symmetric positive semi-definite matrix  $X$ the operation  $(I - \omega P_i)X(I - \omega P_i)$  preserves its positivity [Bhatia, 2009]. Hence the superoperator  $\mathcal{A}$ is a *positive linear map*, leaving the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices invariant.

The spectra of positive linear maps on general (noncommutative) matrix algebras was studied in [Evans and Høegh-Krohn, 1978] that generalized the Perron-Frobenius theorem to this context. The spectral radius of a positive linear map is attained by an eigenvalue for which there exists an eigenvector that is positive semi-definite (see Theorem 6.5 in [Wolf, 2012]). The notion of *irreducibility* for positive linear maps guarantees that the eigenvalue is simple and the corresponding eigenvector is well-defined (up to a sign). What is more is that the eigenvector can be chosen to be a positive definite matrix. This guarantees that the power iterations in  $(7)$  converge along this positive definite matrix with the corresponding simple eigenvalue giving the rate of convergence.

For a system of equations in  $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ , we examine the irreducibility of its corresponding superoperator  $\mathcal{A}$  for any given relaxation value  $\omega$ . The criteria for irreducibility of positive linear maps was developed in [Farenick, 1996] and involve invariant subspaces. A collection  $S$  of (closed) subspaces of the vector space of  $n \times n$  matrices is called trivial if it only contains  $\{0\}$  and the space itself. Given a bounded linear operator  $M$ , let Lat $(M)$  denote the invariant subspace lattice of  $M$ . The following theorem is a specialization of a more general result in [Farenick, 1996] (see Theorem 2) to our superoperator.

**Theorem 3** (Irreducibility of the superoperator  $\mathcal{A}$ ). The positive linear map  $\mathcal{A}$  is irreducible if and only if,  $\bigcap_{i=1}^m \text{Lat}(\boldsymbol{I} - \omega \boldsymbol{P}_i)$  is trivial.

Based on this theorem, we establish the equivalence of the irreducibility of  $\mathcal{A}$ , in the sense of positive linear maps, to a geometric notion of irreducibility defined for alternating projections (2) that is inherently a geometric approach to solving a system of equations  $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ . We recall the Frobenius notion of irreducibility for symmetric matrices. Such a matrix  $M$  is called irreducible if it can not be transformed to block diagonal form by a permutation matrix  $\mathbf{\Pi}$ :

$$\boldsymbol{M} = \boldsymbol{\Pi} \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{M}' & \boldsymbol{0} \ \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{M}'' \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{-1},$$
