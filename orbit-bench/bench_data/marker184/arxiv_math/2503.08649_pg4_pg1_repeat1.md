## CALANCHI AND GROSSI

We observe that the results of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 are influenced by  $\beta$ , even though the weights  $d^{\beta} \in A_2$  for all  $\beta \in (-1,1)$ . This demonstrates that the regularity of the solution to  $(1.2)$  is not solely dependent on the Muckenhoupt class, but rather on the explicit structure of the weight. Lastly, we note that our results extend to more general weights  $w$  that behave similarly near the boundary (see Remark 3.1).

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we provide some additional properties of the weight  $d^{\beta}$  and recall other known results; in Section 3 we give the proof of the main estimates of Theorem  $1.2$ , and in Section 4 we prove Theorems  $1.3$  and  $1.4$ .

## 2. NOTATIONS AND PRELIMINARY KNOWN RESULTS

In the introduction we have introduced the so called Muckenhoupt class  $A_2$ , namely the class of locally integrable, nonnegative, real-valued functions  $w$  that satisfy

(2.1) 
$$\sup_{B \subset \Omega} \left( \frac{1}{|B|} \int_B w \ dx \right) \left( \frac{1}{|B|} \int_B w^{-1} dx \right) < +\infty$$

where the supremum is taken over balls  $B \subset \Omega$ .

In [3] it was proved that that, if  $d$  is the distance function, the weight

$$(2.2) \t w(x) := d^{\beta}(x),$$

belongs to  $A_2$  for  $\beta \in (-1, 1)$  (see Theorem 3.1 in [3]).

Before presenting the main result, we would like to highlight some key properties of  $d$ . We denote by

(2.3) 
$$\Gamma_{\sigma} = \{x \in \overline{\Omega} : d(x) < \sigma\}$$

the portion in  $\overline{\Omega}$  of a tubular neighbourhood of  $\partial\Omega$ . With an abuse of terminology, from now on we will call  $\Gamma_{\sigma}$  a neighbourhood of  $\partial\Omega$ .

**Proposition 2.1.** Let  $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$  a bounded domain with  $\partial\Omega \in C^2$ . Then there exists a small constant  $\sigma > 0$  such that

$$(2.4) \t d \in C^2(\Gamma_\sigma^\circ) \cap C^0(\overline{\Gamma}_\sigma),$$

(2.5) 
$$|\nabla d(x)| = 1 \text{ for all } x \in \Gamma_{\sigma},$$

Moreover, for every measurable nonnegative function  $g:(0,\sigma)\to\mathbb{R}$ 

$$(2.6) \t\t g \circ d \in L^1(\Gamma_\sigma) \Longleftrightarrow g \in L^1(0,\sigma).$$

*Proof.* For  $(2.4)$  and  $(2.5)$  see e.g. [6] Appendix 14.6.

Here's a brief outline of how to prove  $(2.6)$ : from the coarea formula and  $(2.4)$  and  $(2.5)$ , we have, since  $|\nabla d(x)| = 1$ 

$$\int_{\Gamma_{\sigma}} g(d(x)) \ dx = \int_{0}^{\sigma} g(t) \mathcal{H}^{N-1}(\Gamma_{\sigma} \cap \{d=t\}) \ dt,$$

where  $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$  is the Hausdorff measure of  $\Gamma_{\sigma} \cap \{d=t\}$ . Since the  $\partial\Omega$  is  $C^2$ , there exist two positive constants  $c_1$  and  $c_2$  such that

$$c_1 H^{N-1}(\partial\Omega) \le H^{N-1}(\Gamma_\sigma \cap \{d=t\}) \le c_1 H^{N-1}(\partial\Omega)$$

(see e.g.  $[9]$ , Appendix 2.12.3). This ends the proof.
