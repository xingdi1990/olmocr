We may refer to the triple  $(C, \Delta, \varepsilon)$  just as C if the comultiplication and counit are understood. We shall occasionally use the Sweedler notation and write  $\Delta(c) = \sum_i c_{(1)_i} \otimes c_{(2)_i}$  simply as:

$$\Delta(c) = \sum_{(c)} c_{(1)} \otimes c_{(2)} \in C \otimes C.$$

We say C is *cocommutative* if  $\tau \circ \Delta = \Delta$ , where  $\tau: C \otimes C \to C \otimes C$  swap the terms, i.e.,  $\tau(c \otimes c') = c' \otimes c$ . In other words, C is cocommutative if for all  $c \in C$ :

$$\sum_{(c)} c_{(1)} \otimes c_{(2)} = \sum_{(c)} c_{(2)} \otimes c_{(1)}.$$

A homomorphism of coalgebras  $(C, \Delta_C, \varepsilon_C) \to (D, \Delta_D, \varepsilon_D)$  consists of a k-linear homomorphism  $f: C \to D$ such that  $\Delta_D \circ f = (f \otimes f) \circ \Delta_C$  and  $\varepsilon_D \circ f = \varepsilon_C$ . We denote by  $\operatorname{coAlg}_k$  the induced category of k-coalgebras with coalgebra homomorphisms. Notice that  $\mathrm{coAlg}_k$  is equivalent to  $\mathrm{Alg}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}}_k)$ , the category of algebra objects in  $\text{Vect}_{k}^{\text{op}}$ .

**Definition 2.2.** A k-bialgebra H is a k-vector space H together with a k-coalgebra structure  $(H, \Delta, \varepsilon)$  and a k-algebra structure  $(H,\mu,\eta)$  such that  $\Delta\colon H\to H\otimes H$  and  $\varepsilon\colon H\to k$  are algebra homomorphisms (or equivalently,  $\mu: H \otimes H \to H$  and  $\eta: k \to H$  are coalgebra homomorphisms). We say H is commutative if it is commutative as an algebra, and we say  $H$  is cocommutative if it is cocommutative as a coalgebra. We say H is a Hopf algebra if there exists a k-linear function  $S: H \to H$  (necessarily unique) such that  $\mu \circ (\mathrm{id} \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \varepsilon = \mu \circ (S \otimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta.$ 

**Definition 2.3.** Given a k-coalgebra C, a right C-comodule  $(M, \rho)$  consists of a k-vector space M together with a k-linear homomorphism  $\rho: M \to M \otimes C$  that is coassociative and counital:  $(\mathrm{id}_M \otimes \Delta) \circ \rho = (\rho \otimes \mathfrak{g}_M)$  $\mathrm{id}_C \circ \rho$  and  $(\mathrm{id}_M \otimes \varepsilon) \circ \rho = \mathrm{id}_M$ . A (right) C-colinear homomorphism  $f \colon (M,\rho) \to (M',\rho')$  is a k-linear homomorphism  $f \colon M \to M'$  such that  $\rho' \circ f = (f \otimes \mathrm{id}_C) \circ \rho$ . Let  $\mathrm{coMod}_C$  denote the category of right  $C$ -comodules with colinear homomorphisms. Left  $C$ -comodules are defined completely analogously. If  $C$ is cocommutative, then left and right  $C$ -comodules are equivalent and we will simply refer to them as  $C$ comodules. We shall occasionally use the Sweedler notation for the coaction and write simply  $\sum_{(m)} m_{(0)} \otimes$  $m_{(1)}$  for  $\rho(m) = \sum_i m_{(0)_i} \otimes m_{(1)_i} \in M \otimes C$  for any  $m \in M$ .

**Definition 2.4.** A right  $C$ -comodule  $M$  is *finitely cogenerated* if there exists a  $C$ -colinear monomorphism  $M \hookrightarrow C^{\oplus n} := k^{\oplus n} \otimes C.$ 

**Definition 2.5.** A right C-comodule M is *injective* if for every C-colinear monomorphism  $\iota: X \hookrightarrow Y$  and any C-colinear homomorphism  $f: X \to M$ , there exists a C-colinear homomorphism  $g: Y \to M$  such that  $g \circ \iota = f.$ 

In particular, if  $M$  is a finitely cogenerated and injective right  $C$ -comodule, there exists another finitely cogenerated and injective right C-comodule N such that  $M \oplus N \cong C^{\oplus n}$  as comodules, for some  $n \geq 0$ . Let  $\text{Inj}_{\text{fc}}(C)$  denote the category of finitely cogenerated and injective right C-comodules. Then, we have the following result.

**Proposition 2.6.** The category  $\text{Inj}_{\text{fc}}(C)$  is an exact category.

*Proof.* The category  $\operatorname{coMod}_{C}$  is an abelian category as finite limits and colimits in  $\operatorname{coMod}_{C}$  are created under the forgetful functor  $\text{coMod}_C \to \text{Vect}_k$ . Consider a short exact sequence of right C-comodules:

 $0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow N \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow 0.$ 

If *M* and *P* are finitely cogenerated and injective, then so is  $M \oplus P$ , thus as  $N \cong M \oplus P$  we can conclude.  $\Box$ 

**Definition 2.7** ([KP25]). Given a k-coalgebra C, define its *coalgebraic K-theory*  $K^c(C)$  to be the algebraic K-theory spectrum  $K(\text{Inj}_{\text{fc}}(C))$  of the exact category  $\text{Inj}_{\text{fc}}(C)$  of finitely cogenerated and injective right  $C$ -comodules.

The class of finitely cogenerated and injective comodules forms the class of dualizable objects in comodules with respect to a monoidal structure we now make precise. Recall that given a right C-comodule  $(M, \rho)$  and a left C-comodule  $(N, \lambda)$ , the relative cotensor product  $M \square_C N$  is defined as the equalizer in Vect<sub>k</sub>:

$$M \square_C N \longrightarrow M \otimes N \xrightarrow[1 \otimes \lambda]{\rho \otimes 1} M \otimes C \otimes N$$
