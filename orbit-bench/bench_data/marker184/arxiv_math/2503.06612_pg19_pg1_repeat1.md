*Proof.* Let  $B_t = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i C_{i,t}$ . Then  $B_t$  is big and nef. If  $B_t$  is not ample, then there exists an irreducible curve  $D_t$  on  $Y_t$  such that  $B_t \cdot D_t = 0$ . Note that  $D_t \neq C_{j,t}$  for any  $1 \leq j \leq k$ . Thus,  $D_t \cdot C_{j,t} = 0$  for all j. Let  $E_t$  be the exceptional divisor of  $f_t$  and  $D$  be the image of  $D_t$  on  $X$ . By adjunction formula,

$$-2 \leqslant (K_{Y_t} + D_t) \cdot D_t = \left( -\sum_{i} C_{i,t} - E_t + D_t \right) \cdot D_t = D_t^2 - E_t \cdot D_t < -E_t \cdot D_t$$

so  $0 \leq D_t \cdot E_t < 2$ . Note that  $D_t \cdot E_t > 0$  because  $f_t^*(\sum_i C_i) \cdot D_t = -K_X \cdot D > 0$ . Furthermore,  $D_t$  and  $E_t$  intersect at smooth points of  $Y_t$  because every singular point of  $Y_t$  lies on the support of  $\sum_i C_{i,t}$ . Thus,  $D_t \cdot E_t = 1$ . This implies that

$$-K_X \cdot D = f_t^* \left(\sum_i C_i\right) \cdot D_t = \left((p+q)E_t + \sum_i C_{i,t}\right) \cdot D_t = p+q$$

and

 $f^*_{t}D = D_{t} + pqE_{t}$ 

since  $E_t^2 = -\frac{1}{pq}$ . Thus,  $D_t^2 = D^2 - pq$  is an integer. Since  $-2 \leq D_t^2 - E_t \cdot D_t$  (by adjunction) and  $D_t^2 < 0$ , we have  $D_t^2 = -1$  and  $D^2 = pq - 1$ . The equality

$$(K_{Y_t} + D_t) \cdot D_t = -2$$

also implies that  $D_t$  is a smooth rational curve on  $Y_t$ . In particular, D is smooth or has a unique singular point at  $x$ .

Next, we show that D is a  $(p,q)$ -unicuspidal curve well-formed with respect to  $(C,x)$ . Let  $x_1,x_2$  be a local (analytic) coordinate near x such that the local equation of C is  $x_1x_2 = 0$ . Since D is irreducible, we can write the local equation of  $D$  as

$$c_1 x_1^{\alpha} + c_2 x_2^{\beta} + g(x_1, x_2)$$

for some  $c_1, c_2 \neq 0$  and a power series g, such that the coefficients of  $x_1^i$  and  $x_2^j$  in g vanish whenever  $i \leq \alpha$ and  $j \leq \beta$ . Then the local intersection product at x satisfies

$$(D \cdot C)_x = \alpha + \beta.$$

Let  $v = \text{ord}_{E_t} \in \text{QM}(X, C)$ . Then

$$v(D) = v(f_t^*D) = pq.$$

Since  $v(D) \leq \rho \alpha, q\beta$  by the definition of a quasi-monomial valuation, we have  $\alpha \geqslant p$  and  $\beta \geqslant q$ . However,

$$p + q = D \cdot C \geqslant (D \cdot C)_x = \alpha + \beta \geqslant p + q,$$

so  $\alpha = q$  and  $\beta = p$ . This implies that the Newton polygon of D in  $x_1, x_2$  coordinate is precisely the region above the line connecting  $(q,0)$  and  $(0,p)$ , so D is a  $(p,q)$ -unicuspidal curve which is well-formed with respect to  $(C, x)$ .  $\Box$ 

We need the following property about the set of unicuspidal curves on  $X$  well-formed with respect to  $(C,x).$ 

**Lemma 3.9.** Let T denote the set of  $t = \frac{q}{p}$  such that

- There exists a  $(p,q)$ -unicuspidal curve D on X which is well-formed with respect to  $(C,x)$ ,
- $\bullet \ -K_X \cdot D = p + q$
- $D^2 = pq 1$ , and
- $E_t$  is a special divisor over  $X$ .
