the crack tip for  $\beta = 0$ . The greater the positive  $\beta$  is, the higher the reduction is. Similar to Fig. 4, all curves show slightly wavy patterns due to the impact of the density-dependent moduli.

Figure 6:  $T_{22}$  vs.  $r$  ( $T_{22}$  unit:  $10^4$  Pa). In the first panel, at  $r = 0$  (the crack-tip), negative  $\beta$  does not reduce  $T_{22}$  compared with  $T_{22}$  at  $\beta = 0$ . Generally, a more negative value does not necessarily generate greater  $T_{22}$  at the crack tip. In the second panel for  $\beta > 0$ , positive  $\beta$  generates smaller  $T_{22}$ value compared with  $T_{22}$  at  $\beta = 0$ . Greater  $\beta$  creates smaller  $T_{22}$  at  $r = 0$ . Slightly wavy patterns also appear in all the curves due to the effect of the density-dependent moduli.

## $5.3$ $\text{SIF}$

For the current problem, we do not have an asymptotic or analytical solution. Therefore, an explicit description of crack-tip SIF is not available. However, one can utilize the crack-tip SIF defined for the linear elastic fracture mechanics model and use the finite element solution for the nonlinear model to glean some vital physical insight into SIF.

The SIF  $K_I$  in the context of linear elasticity defined as

$$K_I = \lim_{r \to 0^+} \sqrt{2\pi r} T_{22}.$$

It is challenging to analytically compute  $K_I$  for complicated models such as the ones in 3-D that we are investigating in this paper. We compute  $K_I$  numerically for illustrative purposes to understand its value as a function of the nonlinear modeling parameter  $\beta$ . The function  $\sqrt{2\pi r}T_{22}$ vs. r is shown in Fig. 7. For  $\beta = 0, -10, -20, -30$ , the  $K_I$  values are, respectively, 0.0110,  $0.0185, 0.0251, 0.0178$ ; For  $\beta = 0, 10, 20, 30$ , the  $K_I$  values are, respectively, 0.0110, 0.0060,  $0.0037, 0.0026$  (Unit:  $10^4 \text{mm}^{1/2}\text{Pa}$ ). All the  $K_I$  values are very close, implying an identical theoretical  $K_I$  value for all  $\beta$  is highly likely. Such numerical approximation for  $K_I$  shows that the nonlinear model with density-dependent moduli is designed appropriately under the common crack criteria used for the linear-elasticity fracture model. Also, in the two panels of Fig. 7, the curve shapes for  $\beta < 0$  and  $\beta > 0$  are slightly distinct. The  $\beta < 0$  curves show a greater curvature, while those for  $\beta > 0$  show flatter behaviors. Such difference is caused by the sign of  $\beta$ , disclosing how negative and positive  $\beta$  values impact the SIF differently.
