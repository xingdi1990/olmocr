# Report of the Directors 董事會報告

#### **Risks Related to the Contractual Arrangement**

We rely on the Contractual Arrangements with the PRC Contractual Entities for our operations in China, which may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership.

We have relied and expect to continue to rely on the Contractual Arrangements with the PRC Contractual Entities to operate our program production business in China. The Contractual Arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over the PRC Contractual Entities as direct ownership. If we had direct ownership of the PRC Contractual Entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of those entities, which in turn could effect changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management level. However, under the Contractual Arrangements, we rely on the performance by the PRC Contractual Entities and their shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over the PRC Contractual Entities. Therefore, the Contractual Arrangements with the PRC Contractual Entities may not be as effective in ensuring our control over our operations in China as direct ownership would be.

## 與合約安排有關的風險

本公司依賴與中國合約實體的合約安排在中國經營業務, 惟未必如直接所有權般有效地給予我們經營控制權。

本公司依賴與中國合約實體的合約安排在中國經營節目製 作業務,並預期將繼續對此加以依賴。該等合約安排未必 如直接所有權般有效地給予我們對中國合約實體的經營控 制權。如我們擁有中國合約實體的直接所有權,我們將能 行使股東權利,改組該等實體的董事會,因而在受限於任 何適用的受信責任前提下,可行使管理層層面的變動。然 而,根據合約安排,我們依賴中國合約實體及彼等的股東 履行合約責任,以對中國合約實體行使控制權。因此,本 公司與中國合約實體的合約安排在確保本公司控制中國業 務經營上未必如直接所有權般有效。
