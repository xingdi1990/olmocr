### 30. RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEME

The Group operates a defined contribution MPF Scheme under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance for those employees who are eligible to participate in the MPF Scheme. Contributions are made based on a percentage of the employee's basic salaries and are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the MPF Scheme. The assets of the MPF Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The Group's employer contributions vest fully with the employees when contributed into the MPF Scheme.

The total cost charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss of approximately HK\$56,500 (Period 2015: HK\$64,892) represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group in respect of the current financial Year.

#### 31. PENDING LITIGATION

In HCA 1700/2011, since the legal representative of the Company filed the defence on behalf of the Company in December 2011, for almost 5 years, the Plaintiff has not taken any further steps at all in respect of the proceedings. The said law suit was taken out by Mr. Chan Ping Yee (the "Plaintiff") and involves a dishonoured cheque issued by the Company for the amount of HK\$39,000,000 allegedly payable to the Plaintiff. The Law suit came about because there was a possible share transaction which eventually fell through. It has always been the view of the Company's legal representative that the Plaintiff's claim is totally without ground. The Company had taken legal advice and has already given instructions to their legal representative to make an application to strike out the claim with costs, for (1) lack of merits of the claim, and (2) want of prosecution. Such application will be made in due course.

#### 30. 退休福利計劃

本集團根據強制性公積金計劃條例為合資格參與 強積金計劃之僱員設立一項定額供款強積金計劃。 供款乃根據僱員之基本薪金之百分比計算,並根 據該強積金計劃之規則於應付時在綜合損益表內 扣除。該強積金計劃之資產由一個獨立管理基金 持有,與本集團之資產分開處理。本集團之僱主 供款於向強積金計劃供款時全數歸僱員所有。

於綜合損益表扣除之總成本約56,500港元(二零 一五年期間:64,892港元)指本集團就本財政年 度向該等計劃應付之供款。

### 31. 待決訴訟

有關HCA 1700/2011號訴訟,自本公司法律代表 代表本公司於二零一一年十二月入稟抗辯書以來, 原告近五年以來並無就進行訴訟採取任何進一步 行動。上述法律訴訟由Chan Ping Yee 先生(「原 告」)提出,並涉及聲稱應向原告支付一張本公司 發出的金額為39,000,000港元的未能承兑支票。 產生該法律訴訟乃由於一項可能進行之股份交易 最終告吹。本公司法律代表自始至終都認為原告 的索償完全缺乏理據。鑑於(1)有關申索欠缺充分 理據;及(2)訴訟程序中無人作出行動,本公司已 徵詢法律意見並指示其法律代表申請撤銷該訴訟, 訴訟費用由原告承擔。該申請將於適當時候發出。
