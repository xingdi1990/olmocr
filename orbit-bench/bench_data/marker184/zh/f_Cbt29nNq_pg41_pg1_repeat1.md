The directors of the Company anticipate that the application of these new and revised HKFRSs and amendments will have no material financial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

### 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

#### **Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

- has power over the investee;
- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. .

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
