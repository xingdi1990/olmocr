| Gain on acquisition                      |        | 3,828    |

The gain on acquisition represents the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over consideration paid. The consideration paid represents a substantial discount to the book value of GSUSA's net assets at the GSUSA Closing Date, primarily due to the fair value adjustments related to the trade name, fixed assets, and right-of-use lease assets and liabilities compared to book value. The gain on acquisition was primarily the result of prior financial results, a lack of access to capital by the Seller, and the agreed upon purchase price which reflected the fact that GSUSA may need additional capital to fund operating losses.

The fair value of the identified intangible assets, including customer contracts and relationships and trade name were determined using the income-based approach. The fair value of curricula and accreditation and licensing identified intangible assets were determined using the cost approach. The table below presents a summary of intangible assets acquired and the useful lives of these assets (in thousands):

| Intangible Assets                    | Useful life | Amount |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Customer contracts and relationships | 2.5 years   | 744    |
| Curricula                            | 3 years     | 158    |
| Trade name                           | 1 vear      | 35     |
| Accreditation and licensing          | 2.5 years   | 28     |
