Temporary financing may also be obtained from the Bangue de France. These funds do not benefit from the privilege stipulated in the law on soci√©t√©s de cr√©dit foncier, but they are guaranteed by loans and securities assigned for this purpose üñ¨ the account of Caisse Fran√ßaise de Financement Local at the central bank.
