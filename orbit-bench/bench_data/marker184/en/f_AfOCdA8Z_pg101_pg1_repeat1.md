# 3 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

### u. Revenue recognition

Provided it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Groups and the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably, revenue is recognized in the consolidated income statement as follows:

#### i. Telecommunications and other services

Telecommunications services comprise local telephony, local data and broadband, international telecommunications, mobile, and other telecommunications businesses such as outsourcing, consulting and contact centers.

Telecommunications service revenue based on usage of the Groups' network and facilities is recognized when the services are rendered. Telecommunications revenue for services provided for fixed periods is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable fixed period.

Up-front fees received for installation of equipment and activation of customer service are deferred and recognized over the estimated customer relationship period.

Other service income is recognized when services are rendered to customers.

Under certain telecommunications service arrangement, customers can purchase telecommunications equipment together with a fixed period of telecommunications service. When such multiple-element arrangements exist, the amount recognized as revenue upon the sale of the telecommunications equipment is the fair value of the equipment in relation to the fair value of the arrangement taken as a whole. The revenue relating to the service element, which represents the fair value of the servicing arrangement in relation to the fair value of the arrangement taken as a whole, is recognized over the service period. The fair values of each element are determined based on the current market price of each of the elements when sold separately.

Where the Groups are unable to determine the fair value of each of the elements in an arrangement, it uses the residual value method. Under this method, the Groups determine the fair value of the delivered element by deducting the fair value of the undelivered element from the total contract consideration.

To the extent that there is a discount on the arrangement, such discount is allocated between the elements of the contract in such a manner as to reflect the fair value of the elements.

## ii. Sales of goods

Revenue from the sales of goods is recognized when goods are delivered to customers which generally coincides with the time when the customer has accepted the goods and the related risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. Revenue is recorded after deduction of any trade discounts.

## iii. Rental income from operating leases

Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognized in the consolidated income statement in equal installments over the accounting periods covered by the lease term. Lease incentives granted are recognized in the consolidated income statement as an integral part of the aggregate net lease payments receivable. Contingent rentals are recognized as income in the accounting period in which they are earned.
