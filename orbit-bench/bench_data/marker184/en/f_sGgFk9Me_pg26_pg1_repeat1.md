# ONE VISION. ONE VENDOR. ONE CODE-LINE. ONE EXPERIENCE.

#### Expanding within our vertical markets

We operate within eight specific vertical markets which provide room to expand our customer base and grow our solution footprint, adding value to customers.

We have experienced continued success and expansion within each of our markets. Our preconfigured solution approach is fundamental to the ongoing penetration within these markets. We currently offer more than 24 preconfigured solutions.

#### Adding value to existing customers

Our enterprise solution comprises a suite of 14 products that are deeply integrated, built on a common platform with a common user interface. We are committed to taking complexity out of the equation for our customers, through a single, integrated enterprise solution.

We support our customers on their journey with a dedicated sales and marketing approach, which keeps them informed about the latest developments and referential experiences from peer TechnologyOne customers.

Our investment in strategic events including the regional Showcases and biennial Evolve user conference, ensures our customers benefit from a strong community and have the opportunity to collaborate with experts and executives from all areas of the business.

### Expanding our product range and depth

TechnologyOne currently boasts one of the most comprehensive enterprise software suites in the world. We are continuing to extend our product offering through the development of additional features and functions.

This year we acquired Jeff Roorda & Associates (JRA), Australia's leading Strategic Asset Management provider. This acquisition formed part of our strategy to continuously deepen and broaden our enterprise solutions for the industries we operate in.

We only make acquisitions that are in line with our business strategy, and do not endeavour to grow through acquisitions.

This acquisition has enabled us to improve upon our existing offering, particularly for customers who have invested in our Asset Management software. JRA's deep functional and industry knowledge has expanded our leading enterprise solution for asset-intensive organisations, delivering specialist expertise and capability to our customers.

We continued to invest in re-engineering all our products for Ci Anywhere, to ensure customers enjoy the same functionality of our software regardless of the device they are using. By making enterprise software incredibly simple, Ci Anywhere allows us to expand our footprint in our existing customer base.

We are working closely with our customers to ensure we continue to meet their ongoing business needs and provide an increasing range of functions within our enterprise solutions.

## Expanding within our geographies

We have 14 offices globally, located in each state and territory of Australia, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, Asia and the United Kingdom.

Our success has been achieved because of our ability to adapt the company to meet the differing needs of customers in each region. In particular, we adapt our sales strategies within our regions as we identify new and ongoing needs.

As we continue to build on our outstanding success and consistent

growth in Australia and New Zealand. we are also capitalising on emerging opportunities in the United Kingdom, South Pacific and Asia. We expect these regions will contribute significantly to our growth in the years to come.

We will also look to expand into other geographies in the future, as we have built a global software platform that positions us well for growth.
