## OVERVIEW

The area surrounding ERA's operations is internationally recognised for unique ecosystems and biodiversity, significant environmental and cultural heritage value and a long tradition of human habitation.

Due to the sensitive nature of the surrounding environment, ERA strives for safety leadership, environmental protection and strong and enduring relationships with all stakeholders.

ERA's commitment to protect the environment in 2016 was overseen by the Commonwealth Government's Supervising Scientist Branch, which conducts extensive monitoring and research programmes on the Ranger Project Area and Jabiluka Mineral Lease.

ERA will continue to engage with the Mirarr Traditional Owners, local communities and all levels of government to protect the natural environment in which it operates.

## THE MIRARR

The Mirarr are Traditional Owners of the lands on which ERA operates.

Mirarr country encompasses the Ranger Project Area and the Jabiluka Mineral Lease, the town of Jabiru and parts of Kakadu National Park, including the wetlands of the Jabiluka billabong country and the sandstone escarpment of Mount Brockman.

The Mirarr hold beneficial freehold title to traditional country via the Kakadu and Jabiluka Land Trusts and in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.

In 1995, the Mirarr established the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, an incorporated body, to assist them to manage a balance between sustainable development and traditional practice on their land and to direct income from mining royalties across a wide range of fields and activities that cover heritage, economic and community development, education, training and employment.

ERA recognises that the support of Traditional Owners is critically important to its current operations, future projects and successful rehabilitation.
