### 2.3 Changes in accounting policies, disclosures, standards and interpretations

#### AASB 9 Financial Instruments

oplication Date of Standard: 1 January 2018, Application Date: 1 January 2018

ASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces AASB 139. This new version supersedes AASB 9 issued in December 2009 (as amended) and AASB 9 (issued in December 2010) and includes a model for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model and a substantiallyr formed approach to hedge accounting.

ASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. However, the Standard is available for early adoption. The own credit changes can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise changing the counting for financial instruments.

#### Classification and measurement

ASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for classification and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements of AASB 139. There are also some changes made in relation to financial liabilities.

The main changes are described below.

#### nancial assets

a. Financial assets that are debt instruments will be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity's business model for managing the financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.

 $\mathbf{b}$  Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income. Dividends in respect of these investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling on usposal of the instrument.

Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing ยง) eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring sets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.

## inancial liabilities

Jhanges introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities are limited to the measurement of liabilities ssignated at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.

Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:

The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI) The remaining change is presented in profit or loss

AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was caused by changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to be measured at fair value. This change in accounting means that gains or losses attributable to changes in the entity's own credit risk would be recognised in OCI. These amounts recognised in OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if the liability is ever repurchased at a discount.

## **Impairment**

The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss impairment model that will require more timely ecognition of expected credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected credit Isses from when financial instruments are first recognised and to recognise full lifetime expected losses on a fore timely basis.
