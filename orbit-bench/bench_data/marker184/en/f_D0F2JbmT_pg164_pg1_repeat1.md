## One-Off Awards

One-off awards of Deferred Share Rights were granted under the Equity Incentive Plan ("EIP") for no cost to the employee and entitle the participant to receive one fully paid ordinary share in the Company per right. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 one-off awards were granted to employees:

- to replace existing cash-based service and retention arrangements where payment was due to vest over the longer-term; and
- ٠ as one-off awards to new and existing employees for recruitment and retention purposes.

All share rights issued expire on the earlier of their vesting date where performance conditions are not met or termination of the individual's employment except in certain special circumstances. The only performance condition is continued employment.

Amount recognised during the reporting period: Expense \$0.1 million (31 December 2015: Expense \$0.5 million).
