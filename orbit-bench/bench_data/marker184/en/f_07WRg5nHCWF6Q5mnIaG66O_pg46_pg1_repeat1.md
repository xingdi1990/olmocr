EBITDA for the five years is based on management's internal forecast and projections. EBITDA margins were projected to be 7% to 8% for IFM and 11% to 12% for WAF.

## Sensitivities

The most sensitive inputs to the discounted cash flow model are in the IFM segment and relate to the discount rate, the revenue growth rate, and EBITDA margins. All else being equal, a 100 basis points decrease in the revenue growth rates, a 25 basis points decrease in EBITDA margin, or a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate would, on an individual basis, result in an immaterial impairment in the IFM CGU.

## 10. Other assets

Other assets at December 31, 2023 include equity accounted investments in Gitxaala Horizon North Services Limited Partnership ("Gitxaala") and Big Spring Lodging Limited Partnership ("BSL LP"), both joint ventures that are 49% owned by the Corporation with carrying value of \$13.1 million (December 31, 2022 - \$13.1 million) and \$2.2 million (December 31, 2022 - \$1.9 million), respectively.

Effective August 15, 2023, the Corporation reached an agreement with its lenders to amend its credit facility and extend the maturity date to September 7, 2026. The amended credit facility has an available limit of \$260 million plus an uncommitted accordion of \$150 million, and is secured by a \$400 million first fixed and floating charge debenture over all assets of the Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The interest rate is calculated on a grid pricing structure based on the Corporation's debt to EBITDA ratio. Amounts drawn on the credit facility incur interest at bank prime rate plus 0.50% to 1.75% or the Bankers' Acceptance rate plus 1.50% to 2.75%. The credit facility has a standby fee on the committed available limit ranging from 0.30% to 0.55% per annum.

As at December 31, 2023, the Corporation was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants related to the credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of \$16.7 million (2022 - \$10.1 million).

The estimated present value of rehabilitating the sites at the end of their useful lives has been estimated using existing technology, adjusted for inflation and discounted using a risk-free rate. The Corporation has estimated the net present value of its asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2023 to be \$6.4 million (December 31, 2022 - \$11.6 million) based on a total future liability of \$6.6 million (December 31, 2022 - \$12.3 million). The Corporation used an average risk free interest rate of 3.88% and an inflation rate of 1.72% (December 31, 2022 - 3.94% and 2.06%, respectively) to calculate the net present value of its asset retirement obligations as at December 31, 2023. The timing of these payments is dependent on various factors, such as the estimated lives of the equipment and industry activity in the region but is anticipated to occur up to 2028.
