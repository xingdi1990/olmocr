## Fixed Remuneration - Base Salary

The fixed remuneration for each senior executive is influenced by the nature and responsibilities of each role and knowledge, skills and experience required for each position. Fixed remuneration provides a base level of remuneration which is market competitive and comprises a base salary inclusive of statutory superannuation. It is structured as a total employment cost package.

Key management personnel are offered a competitive base salary that comprises the fixed component of pay and rewards. External remuneration consultants may provide analysis and advice to ensure base pay is set to reflect the market for a comparable role. No external advice was taken this year. Base salary for key management personnel is reviewed annually to ensure the executives' pay is competitive with the market. The pay of key management personnel is also reviewed on promotion. There is no guaranteed pay increase included in any key management personnel's contract.

## Variable Remuneration - Short Term Incentives (STI)

Discretionary cash bonuses may be paid to senior executives annually, subject to the requisite Board and shareholder approvals where applicable.

In determining the extent of his performance based bonus, the Company took into consideration the key performance indicators of Mr Wall and the Company.
