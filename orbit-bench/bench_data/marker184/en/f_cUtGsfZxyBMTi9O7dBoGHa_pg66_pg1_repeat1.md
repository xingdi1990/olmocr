The Company maintains a valuation allowance for its gross deferred income tax assets of \$129.4 million (U.S. operations - \$129.4 million; Other - less than \$0.1 million) and \$130.6 million (U.S. operations - \$130.6 million; Other - less than \$0.1 million) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company's businesses have generated substantial operating losses in prior years. These losses can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future taxable income; however, it is uncertain whether the Company will generate the taxable income necessary to utilize these losses or other reversing temporary differences. This uncertainty has caused management to place a full valuation allowance on its December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 net deferred income tax assets, excluding the deferred income tax asset and liability amounts set forth in the paragraph below.

In 2023, the Company (i) decreased by \$2.1 million its valuation allowance primarily due to deferred tax liabilities assumed from corporate acquisitions; and (ii) increased by \$0.3 million its valuation allowance relating to a change in indefinite life deferred income tax liabilities.

In 2022, the Company (i) increased by \$2.1 million its valuation allowance associated with business interest expense carryforwards with an indefinite life; and (ii) increased by \$0.1 million its valuation allowance relating to a change in indefinite life deferred income tax liabilities.

The Company carries net deferred income tax liabilities of \$5.0 million and \$4.2 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, that consists of:

- \$4.1 million and \$3.8 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets; and
- \$0.9 million and \$0.4 of deferred state income tax liabilities.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") modified the U.S. net operating loss deduction, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Act, however, did not limit the utilization, in 2018 and later tax years, of U.S. net operating losses generated in 2017 and prior tax years.
