## b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient funds to settle financial liabilities when they fall due. This includes having insufficient levels of committed credit facilities. The Group's objective is to maintain efficient use of cash and debt facilities in order to balance the cost of borrowing and ensuring sufficient availability of credit facilities, to meet forecast capital requirements. The Group adopts a prudent approach to cash management which ensures sufficient levels of cash and committed credit facilities are maintained to meet working capital requirements. Liquidity is reviewed continually by the Group's treasury departments through daily cash monitoring, review of available credit facilities and forecasting and matching of cash flows.

At 31 December 2016 the Group had undrawn bank facilities of \$1,686.4 million (31 December 2015: \$1,861.5 million), and undrawn guarantee facilities of \$546.3 million (31 December 2015: \$563.9 million).
