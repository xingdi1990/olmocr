## b. Amortized cost

Financial assets are classified at amortized cost if both of the following criteria are met and the financial assets are not designated as FVTPL: (i) the object of the Company's business model for these financial assets is to collect their contractual cash flows, and (ii) the asset's contractual cash flows represent "solely payments of principal and interest".

A provision is recorded when the estimated recoverable amount of the financial asset is lower than its carrying amount. At each reporting period, the Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. When sold or impaired, any accumulated fair value adjustments previously recognized are included in profit or loss.

# c. FVOCI

For equity securities that are not held for trading, the Company can make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to classify the instruments at FVOCI with all subsequent changes in fair value being recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). This election is available for each separate investment. For financial assets classified at FVOCI, fair value changes are recognized in OCI while dividends are recognized in profit or loss. On disposal of the financial asset, the cumulative fair value change remains in OCI and is not recycled to net profit or loss.

## d. Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Company changes its business model for managing its financial assets.

## ii) Derivative warrant liabilities

Share warrants (not including compensation warrants) are considered a derivative as they are not indexed solely to the Company's own stock.

During the year ended August 31, 2021, the Company issued convertible debentures with detachable warrants for the Company's common shares. The warrants are classified as a derivative financial liability as they are potentially exercisable in cash or on a cashless basis resulting in a variable number of shares being issued. The warrants were initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at FVTPL.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to estimate their fair values at each reporting date.

## iii) Agent warrants and financing warrants

Warrants issued to agents in connection with equity financing are recorded at fair value and charged to share issuance costs associated with the offering with an offsetting credit to warrants reserve within shareholders' equity.

Warrants included in units offered to subscribers in connection with financings are valued using the residual value method whereby proceeds are first allocated to the fair value of common shares and the excess if any, allocated to warrants.
