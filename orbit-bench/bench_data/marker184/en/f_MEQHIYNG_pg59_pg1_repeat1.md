### 6 - PROVISIONS

In 2015, French tax authorities investigated the income declared and the tax paid for 2012 and 2013. Following the tax assessment, the tax authorities expressed their disagreement with the tax treatment of the following two points: the taxation in Ireland of the income from the Dublin branch of Dexia Municipal Agency, which has now been closed, and the diductibility of provisions for non-performing loans.

order to take into account the risk of an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings, Caisse Française de Financement Local has recorded a provision for additional income tax in the amount of EUR 38 million. Nonetheless, Caisse Française de Financement Local does not agree with the position of the tax authorities and will appeal within the framework of legal recourse allowed by current tax regulations.
