## Colombia

Funds From Operations at our Colombian business were \$117 million in 2022 versus \$128 million in the prior year. On a local currency basis, Funds From Operations was 4% higher than the prior year due to the benefit from newly acquired and commissioned facilities during the year (\$14 million and 242 GWh), higher generation that was 16% above long-term average and higher average revenue per MWh due to inflation indexation and recontracting initiatives, partly offset by interest expense as a result of accelerating refinancing initiatives. The increase was more than offset by weakening of the Colombian peso versus the U.S. dollar.

Funds From Operations at our wind business were \$326 million in 2022 versus \$396 million in the prior year. On a same store basis, net of growth, and asset sales in 2021 at our North America and Europe portfolios (\$130 million and 387 GWh), Funds From Operations were higher than prior year due to favorable resources and a higher average revenue per MWh due to inflation indexation, generation mix and higher market prices in Spain.

## UTILITY-SCALE SOLAR OPERATIONS ON PROPORTIONATE BASIS

|-----------------------------|-------|-------|
| Revenue.<br>                | 374   | 348   |

| Generation (GWh) – LTA      | 2.406 | 2.016 |
| $Generation (GWh) - actual$ | 1.878 |       |

Funds From Operations at our utility-scale solar business were \$253 million in 2022 versus \$185 million in the prior year, as the benefit from newly acquired and commissioned facilities, including a gain on sale of a solar development project in North America (\$25 million and 249 GWh), and higher market prices in Spain was partly offset by lower resources.
