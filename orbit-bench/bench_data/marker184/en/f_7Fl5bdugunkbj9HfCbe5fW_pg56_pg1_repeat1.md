 $(1)$ Non-IFRS measures. For reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS measure see "Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

 $(2)$ Actual generation includes 99 GWh (2022: 70 GWh) from facilities that do not have a corresponding long-term average. See PART 9 - Presentation to Stakeholders' for why we do not consider long-term average for certain of our facilities.

For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Funds From Operations were \$255 million versus \$225 million in the prior year. Funds From Operations increased \$30 million primarily due to contributions from growth, strong asset availability, and favorable hydroelectric generation, particularly at our assets in the Brazil and Colombia.
