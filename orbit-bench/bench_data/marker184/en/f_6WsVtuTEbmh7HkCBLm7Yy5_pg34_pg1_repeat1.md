We have made certain assumptions including expected forecasted demand by utilizing information such as inventory quantities and aging, historical sales of inventory and general market understanding. Reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories, could result in the recognition of write-down expenses in future periods.

ii) Amortization

Management makes estimates of the appropriate useful lives to be assigned to intangible assets based on the individual circumstances of an acquisition. Management reviews the appropriateness of the lives assigned and makes adjustments prospectively, where necessary.

Management makes estimates of sustainable earnings, future expected cash flows and discount rates in the determination of the value-in-use or fair value less costs of disposal of cash-generating units ("CGUs").

iv) Provision against accounts receivable

Management makes estimates on the expected credit losses ("ECLs") of accounts receivable balances based on customer specific facts and circumstances as well as past experience of write-offs. Changes in the economic conditions in which the Company's customers operate and their underlying financial stability may impact these estimates.

v) Employee future benefits

Management estimates the discount rates, retirement age and future costs of benefits associated with providing future employee benefits and exercises judgment to determine how many employees will utilize these benefits.

vi) Tax assets

Deferred tax assets and liabilities contain estimates about the nature and timing of future permanent and temporary differences as well as the future tax rates that will apply to those differences. Changes in tax laws and rates as well as changes to the expected timing of reversals may have a significant impact on the amounts recorded for deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management closely monitors current and potential changes to tax law and bases its estimates on the best available information at each reporting date.

vii) Depreciation

Management estimates future residual values and the rate at which the useful lives of property and equipment are consumed to determine appropriate depreciation charges. Estimates of residual value and useful lives are based on data and information from various sources, including vendors, industry practice and Company-specific history. Management reviews the appropriateness of the lives assigned and makes adjustments prospectively, where necessary.
