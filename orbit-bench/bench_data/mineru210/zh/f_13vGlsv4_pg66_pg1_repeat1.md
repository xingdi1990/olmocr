# (vii) Reputational risk

Cabbeen is one of the leading Chinese fashion casual designer brands and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining and promoting our brands will depend on our product design, marketing efforts and product quality. In addition, effect of our marketing activities depends on our ability to adapt to the rapid changing media environment, including social media and online advertising campaigns. Should existing and potential customers lose confidence in Cabbeen/or one of its brands, or in the industry in general, because of negative publicity, the Group’s sales would decrease. To safeguard and manage the brand, it is important that the Group continues to uphold its brand value, corporate image, product safety and maintain high business ethics. In addition, it is also important that communication with our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders is accurate, transparent and reliable.

# (vii) 聲譽風險

卡賓為中國領先的時尚休閒設計師品牌之一，我們的成功取決於我們維持並提升我們的品牌形象及聲譽的能力。維持並提升我們的品牌將取決於我們的產品設計、營銷力度及產品質素。此外，我們的營銷活動的效果將取決於我們適應快速變化的媒體環境的能力，包括社交媒體及網絡廣告活動。倘由於負面宣傳，現有及潛在客戶對卡賓╱或其任何品牌或整個行業失去信心，本集團的銷售將會下降。為維護及管理品牌，本集團繼續維護其品牌價值、公司形象、產品安全及維持高度的商業道德至關重要。此外，與我們的股東、客戶及其他持份者保持準確、透明及可靠的溝通亦相當重要。
