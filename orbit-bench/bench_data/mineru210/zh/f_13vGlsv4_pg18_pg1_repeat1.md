# E-commerce

#

The rapid development of e-commerce and the emergence. of new media as convenient sales channels in recent years changed the retail industry and consumers' shopping behavior. We have accordingly started to develop our own e-commerce sales channels since June 2015 to tap the market potentials. We operate online stores on popular e-commerce platforms including Tmall, JD.com, Wechat and our official website www.cabbeen.com. Retail sales revenue generated from our online platforms, including. platforms operated by us and our distributor, increased by more than $4 3 . 8 \%$ from RMB172 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 to RMB247 million for the year ended. 31 December 2016.

# Partial transformation to consignment 1 model

We have been transforming retail outlets operated under the wholesale model to the consignment model. We believe the consignment model allows more efficient inventory flow among retail outlets in different markets by saving the lead time for inventory distribution among distributors in different locations, enabling the Group to. have more control over the inventory mix to be produced and displayed in retail outlets, and hence shorten the time between product development, production planning and delivery of products to the points of sales. The Group believes these benefits will improve our supply chain efficiency, the inventory turnover and sell-through rate at distribution channel and in turn improve the Group's revenue, profits and sustain growth. We believe this could attract more distributors to join us for expanding our retail network in local markets as well..
