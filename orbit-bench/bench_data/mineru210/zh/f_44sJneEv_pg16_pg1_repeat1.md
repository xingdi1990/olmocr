$( j )$ Compare to the estimation in the Prospectus, the schedule of launching the application for the live stream videos to be watched online via mobile and other platforms had been delayed, therefore the utilised amount of the net proceeds from the Placing as at 31 December 2016 was lower than the estimated relative utilisation as at the same date disclosed in the Prospectus.

$\langle 1 \rangle$ (ii) During the Review Period, the Group had provided production services to a television station for certain variety programs. As the cost for artists and production teams were higher than the estimated production costs in the Prospectus, the utilisation of the net proceeds from the Placing as at 31 December 2016 was higher than the estimated relative utilisation as at the same date disclosed in the Prospectus.

(iii) During the Review Period, the Group tried to identify a suitable location to set up the studio. However, there was no suitable site identified. Therefore, no relative net proceeds from the Placing were utilised. The Group intends to change the use of this part of proceeds from the Placing to the recent developed Entertainment On Demand System business. Please refer to the following paragraphs headed “Change in use of proceeds” for the details.
