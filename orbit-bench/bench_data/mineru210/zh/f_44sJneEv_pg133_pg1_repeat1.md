The recoverable amount of the CGU of the mobile live broadcasting business in PRC is determined by the value-in-use calculation. The calculation was carried out by cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year period. Cash flows for the five year period are estimated based on the management’s expectation for the market in the first year and an average annual growth rate of turnover of $20 \%$ thereafter until year 5 and a pre-tax discount rate of $\angle B A C = 9 0 ^ { \circ }$ . Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using an estimated weighted average growth rate of $3 \%$ . The estimated growth rates used are comparable to the growth rate for the industry.

中國移動直播現金產生單位的可收回金額乃透過使用價值計算釐定。計算基於根據管理層批准的涵蓋五年期間的財務預算之現金流量預測作出。五年期間的現金流量乃根據管理層對第一年市場發展的預期及按其後直至第五年止營業額年均增長率 $20 \%$ 及預扣稅折現率 $2 7 \%$ 估計。五年期間之後的現金流量以估計加權平均增長率 $9 9 \div$ 推算。所使用估計增長率與行業增長率相若。

The key assumption used in the value-in-use calculation is the average annual growth rate of turnover of the mobile live broadcasting business, which is determined based on the management’s expectation for market development. The discount rate used is pre-tax and reflects specific risks relating to mobile live broadcasting segment. Any adverse change in the key assumptions could reduce the recoverable amount below carrying amount.

使用價值計算所使用的主要假設為移動直播業務營業額的平均年增長率，乃根據管理層對市場發展的預期而釐定。所使用的折現率為除稅前及反映有關移動直播分部的特定風險。主要假設的任何不利變動均可能使可收回金額減至低於賬面值。

The management reassessed the recoverable amount of the CGU of mobile live broadcasting business in PRC as at 31 December 2016 by reference to the discounted cash flow calculation with the above estimation and was of the opinion that no impairment loss should be recognised as the recoverable amount of the CGU is higher than its carrying amount.

管理層透過參考折現現金流量計算連同上述估計重新評估於二零一六年十二月三十一日移動直播業務現金產生單位的可收回金額，並認為，由於現金產生單位的其可收回金額大於其賬面值，故無須確認減值虧損。
