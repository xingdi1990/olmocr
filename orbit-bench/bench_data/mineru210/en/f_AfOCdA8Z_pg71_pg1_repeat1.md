(11) Licensed access to floor space

Under the licence agreement dated December 27, 2013, PCCW Solutions has been afforded certain limited access rights to floor space for it and members of the Solutions Group at a number of HKTC’s Premises. Pursuant to a licence agreement signed between HK Telecom and HKTC, HKTC granted to HK Telecom a licence to, among other things, install, store, operate and maintain equipment, machinery, chattels and installations at HKTC’s Premises. HKTC continues to meet and defray all costs, expenses and outgoings of HKTC’s Premises but HK Telecom is responsible for reimbursing HKTC the outgoings on a periodic basis. HKTC is also required to pay the amount of any income or profit received or to be received by HKTC to HK Telecom in respect of HKTC’s Premises. Accordingly, the licence fees paid by the Solutions Group are passed on by HKTC to HK Telecom pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement. In effect, therefore, these licensing arrangements are akin to direct arrangements between HK Telecom and the Solutions Group.

On December 27, 2013, PCCW (Macau), Limitada (“PCCW Macau”), a company within the HKT Limited Group, and PCCW-HKT Technical Services Limited (“TSL”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PCCW, entered into a sub-contracting agreement (as subsequently amended on December 23, 2016). PCCW Macau has contracted with various third parties for the provision of solutions services with various operators in Macau such as information technology related systems within hotels and casinos. Rather than performing the work itself, PCCW Macau has sub-contracted the work to TSL. Accordingly, the work is carried out by TSL and all fees received in respect of the work are passed on by PCCW Macau to TSL after PCCW Macau has deducted sub-contracting fees.
