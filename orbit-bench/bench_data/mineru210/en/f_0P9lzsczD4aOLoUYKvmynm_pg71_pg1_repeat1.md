# Key Business Metrics

We regularly review the number of product placements and cumulative product placement as key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, we anticipate these will change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows.

During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our product placements (units recognized as revenue) were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Year Ended December 3T,</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Product s:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Handheld</td><td>402</td><td>370</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>66</td><td>80</td></tr></table>

The number of product placements vary considerably from period-to-period due to the type and size of our customers and concentrations among larger government customers as described above. We expect continued fluctuations in our period-to-period number of product placements.

Our cumulative product placements consist of the following number of devices:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">December 31,</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative Product Placements:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Handheld</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,020</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td> 431</td><td> 365</td></tr></table>
