# DIRECTORS‘ REPORT

# REMUNERATION Report (Audited) (continued)

# (b) Compensation of Key Management Personnel (continued)

The amount of aggregate compensation sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is apportioned amongst directors is reviewed annually. The Board considers advice from external consultants as well as the fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable companies when undertaking the annual review process.

Each director receives a fee for being a director of the Company. An additional fee may also be paid for each Board committee on which a director sits. The payment of additional fees for serving on a committee recognises the additional time commitments required by directors who serve on one or more sub committees.

Each non-executive director receives $\$ 49,000$ per annum effective from 1 July 2014 $\$ 28,000$ per annum prior to 1 July 2014), exclusive of any superannuation obligations for being a director of the Company. The exception to this fee structure is the Chairman of the Board who receives $\$ 90,000$ per annum effective from 1 July 2016 (\$62,000 per annum prior to 1 July 2016) exclusive of any superannuation (\$31,846 per annum prior to 1 July 2014).

Non-executive directors have long been encouraged by the Board to hold shares in the Company (purchased by the director on market). It is considered good governance for directors to have a stake in the Company on whose board they sit. The compensation of non-executive directors for the year ended 30 September 2016 is detailed as per the disclosures on page 30.

# (D) Executive Compensation

# Objective

The entity aims to reward executives with a level and mix of compensation commensurate with their position and responsibilities within the entity so as to:

reward executives for company, business unit and individual performance against targets set by remuneration committee to appropriate benchmarks;   
align the interests of executives with those of shareholders;   
link rewards with the strategic goals and performance of the Company; and   
ensure total compensation is competitive by market standards.

# Structure

In determining the level and make-up of executive remuneration, the remuneration committee will review individual performance, relevant comparative compensation in the market and internally and, where appropriate, external advice on policies and practices.

Since an annual review of the remuneration for the executives in July 2014, there has not been any changes to the Chief Executive Officer remuneration of $\$ 250,000$ per annum exclusive of any superannuation effective from 1 July 2014 $\$ 175,000$ per annum prior to 1 July 2014) and the Company Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of $\$ 200,000$ per annum exclusive of any superannuation effective from 1 July 2014 (\$162,500 per annum prior to 1 July 2014).

# (E) Fixed Compensation

# Objective

Fixed compensation is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. The process consists of a review of companywide, business unit and individual performance, relevant comparative compensation in the market and internally and, where appropriate, external advice on policies and practices.

# Structure

Executives are given the opportunity to receive their fixed remuneration in a variety of forms including cash and fringe benefits such as motor vehicles and expense payment plans. It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating undue cost for the Company.

(F) Other Compensation

Notwithstanding Guideline 8.2 of the ASX Corporate Governance Council Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations which provides that non-executive Directors should not receive Options, the Directors consider that the grant of the options is designed to encourage the Directors to have a greater involvement in the achievement of the Company’s objectives and to provide an incentive to strive to that end by participating in the future growth and prosperity of the Company through share ownership.
