# 16. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted number of shares used in computing earnings (loss) per share:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">Year Ended December 31,</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td><td>2021</td></tr><tr><td>Basic weighted average shares outstanding</td><td>134,647,238</td><td>132,602,747</td><td>120,877,480</td></tr><tr><td>Net effect of dilutive stock awards based upon the treasury stock method</td><td></td><td>5,778,548</td><td>7,619,740</td></tr><tr><td> Dilutive weighted average shares outstanding</td><td>134,647,238</td><td>138,381,295</td><td>128,497,220</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Basic earnings (loss) per share Diluted earnings (loss) per share</td><td>$ (0.14) $</td><td>0.23 $</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$ (0.14) $</td><td>0.22 $</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-dilutive share-based awards excluded from the calculation of dilutive</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>earnings per share</td><td>8,557,396</td><td>9,203</td><td></td></tr></table>
