# Film Business

Revenue from our fi lm business decreased $5 . 8 \%$ from $\cup \ S \$ 28.5$ million in FY2015 to $\cup \ S \$ 26.8$ million in FY2016, primarily due to a decrease in the box offi ce revenue generated by IMAX fi lms.

Box offi ce revenue per screen decreased $3 0 . 6 \%$ from $\cup \ S \$ 1.34$ million for FY2015 to $\cup { \mathsf { S P O } } . 9 3$ million in FY2016 as a result of the strong performance of the Companyâ€™s fi lm slate in FY2015, which included the top grossing Hollywood fi lm of all time in China, Furious 7, along with Avengers Age of Ultron and Jurrassic World. The depreciation of the RMB relative to the USD also impacted recorded box offi ce in FY2016 versus FY2015.
