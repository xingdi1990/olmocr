# 35.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED

# f) Net fair values of financial assets and liabilities continued

# Fair value hierarchy continued

During the period there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value hierarchies.  Level 3 instruments comprise unlisted equity and stapled securities and unlisted financial assets at fair value through profit and loss; the determination of the fair value of these securities is discussed below.  The tables below analyse the changes in Level 3 instruments as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>12 months to December 2016 $m</td><td>12 months to December 2015 $m</td></tr><tr><td>Unlisted equity and stapled securities available-for-sale</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Balance at beginning of reporting period.</td><td>72.3</td><td>63.7</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions</td><td>0.4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Transfers1</td><td>4.6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Disposals</td><td>(71.9)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income</td><td>-</td><td>8.6</td></tr><tr><td>Balance at reporting date</td><td>5.4</td><td>72.3</td></tr></table>

Transfers from equity accounted investments following loss of significant influence in LCIP Co‐Investment Unit Trust.

<table><tr><td></td><td>12 months to December 2016 $m</td><td>12 months to December 2015 $m</td></tr><tr><td>Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Balance at beginning of reporting period</td><td>51.8</td><td>47.0</td></tr><tr><td>Additions</td><td>1.3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Gains recognised through profit or loss</td><td>75.0</td><td>4.8</td></tr><tr><td>Balance at reporting date</td><td>128.1</td><td>51.8</td></tr></table>

Changing inputs to the Level 3 valuations to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change significantly amounts recognised in profit or loss, total assets, total liabilities or total equity.

# Methods and valuation techniques

The methods and valuation techniques used for the purpose of measuring fair value are unchanged compared to the previous reporting period.

# Listed and unlisted investments

The fair values of listed investments are determined on an active market valuation basis using observable market data such as current bid prices. The fair values of unlisted investments are determined by the use of internal valuation techniques using discounted cash flows. Where practical the valuations incorporate observable market data.  Assumptions are generally required with regard to future expected revenues and discount rates.

# Listed and unlisted debt

Fair value has been determined based on either the listed price or the net present value of cash flows using current market rates of interest.  The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s statement of financial position approximate fair values.
