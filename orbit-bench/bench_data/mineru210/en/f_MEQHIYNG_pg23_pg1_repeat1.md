# 7. Change in debt that does not benefit from the legal privilege

he asset surplus (assets exceeding obligations foncières and registered covered bonds) and miscellaneous needs are nanced by equity and debt that does not benefit from the privilege of the law on sociétés de crédit foncier.

Such financing is obtained through the parent company. At the end of December 2015, the funds borrowed from SFIL within the framework of the financing agreement were made up of different loans with maturities that could initially run from one day to ten years with an Euribor or Eonia index.

Temporary financing may also be obtained from the Banque de France. These funds do not benefit from the privilege stipulated in the law on sociétés de crédit foncier, but they are guaranteed by loans and securities assigned for this purpose in the account of Caisse Française de Financement Local at the central bank. Caisse Française de Financement Local had already used such financing in the past. Since the creation of SFIL, Caisse Française de Financement Local has not contracted any loans from the Banque de France, except when it used small sums to test the access procedure for such funding. Neither did it contract any loans from credit institutions other than its parent company.

The change in financing that does not benefit from the legal privilege, excluding accrued interest not yet due, can be presented as follows.

<table><tr><td>EUR billions</td><td>12/31/2014</td><td>12/31/2015</td></tr><tr><td>Parent company</td><td>6.2</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>Banque de France</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>6.2</td><td>5.5</td></tr></table>

he decrease in debt not benefiting from the legal privilege was the result of the decrease of the cover pool and the change the level of over-collateralization in 2015.

The quality of Caisse Française de Financement Local’s portfolio can also be seen in the weighting of its assets within the framework of the calculation of the solvency ratio. SFIL chose the advanced method within the framework of the calculation of the solvency ratio and capital adequacy. Banking regulator authorized the Company to use the advanced internal models developed for the consolidated calculation and reporting of capital requirements for credit risk. The calculation of such weighting in particular combines the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) of the counterparty.

This enables Caisse Française de Financement Local to present an analysis of its exposure as of December 31, 2015, broken down by risk weighting, such as used for the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk.
