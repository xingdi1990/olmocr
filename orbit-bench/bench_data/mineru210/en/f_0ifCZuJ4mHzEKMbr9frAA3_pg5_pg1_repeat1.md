# ITEM 1. BUSINESS

# General

We are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On February 16, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. from Exantas Capital Corp. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate property through direct ownership and joint ventures. We are externally managed by ACRES Capital, LLC (our “Manager”) a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively “ACRES”), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, industrial and office property in top United States, or U.S., markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its services.

Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including the payment of quarterly distributions when approved by our board of directors, (our “Board”) and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the maturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments.

Our investment strategy targets the following CRE credit investments, including:

• Floating-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans;   
• First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes;   
• Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes;   
• Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the property underlying the investment; and   
• CRE equity investments.

We generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our interest-bearing assets and the cost to finance our ownership of those assets, including corporate debt. We also derive rental income from our direct equity investments in commercial real estate property.

We typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $\$ 10.0$ million and $\$ 100.0$ million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we selectively originated three CRE loans with total commitments of $\$ 68.2$ million. At December 31, 2023, our CRE loan portfolio at par comprised $\$ 1.9$ billion of floating-rate CRE whole loans with a weighted average spread of $3 . 7 7 \%$ over the one-month benchmark interest rates utilized, which have a weighted average floor of $0 . 7 0 \%$ . Additionally, our CRE loan portfolio comprised one fully reserved $\$ 4.7$ million mezzanine loan at December 31, 2023.

# Our Business Strategy

The core components of our business strategy are:

Investment in CRE assets. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans and CRE equity investments. Our goal is to allocate $90 \%$ to $100 \%$ of our equity to our CRE assets.

Managing our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2023, we managed $\$ 2.2$ billion of assets, including $\$ 1.5$ billion of assets that were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager, with the assistance of ACRES, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior management of ACRES has extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conducts detailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager actively monitors them for early detection of trouble or deterioration. If a default occurs, we will use our senior management team’s asset management experience in seeking to mitigate the severity of any loss and to optimize the recovery from assets collateralizing the investment.
