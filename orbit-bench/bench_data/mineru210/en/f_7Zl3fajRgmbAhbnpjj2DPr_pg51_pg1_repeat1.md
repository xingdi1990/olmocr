In April 2023, we drew the maximum $\$ 6$ billion on the term loan facility to partially fund the Shaw Transaction, consisting of $\$ 2$ billion from each of the three tranches. The three tranches mature on April 3, 2026, 2027, and 2028, respectively. During the year, we subsequently repaid $\$ 1.6$ billion of the tranche maturing in 2027, such that the credit limit for the facility had been reduced to $\$ 4.4$ billion as at December 31, 2023. In February 2024, we used the proceeds from the issuance of $\cup 5 \$ 2.5$ billion of senior notes (see “Issuance of senior and subordinated notes and related debt derivatives” below) to repay an additional $\$ 3.4$ billion of the facility such that only $\$ 1$ billion remains outstanding under the April 2026 tranche.

In April 2023, we also assumed $\$ 4.55$ billion principal amount of Shaw’s senior notes upon closing the Shaw Transaction, of which $\$ 500$ million was subsequently repaid at maturity during the year

Issuance of senior and subordinated notes and related debt derivatives   
Below is a summary of the senior and subordinated notes that we issued in 2023 and 2022. In 2022, substantially all of the proceeds were recognized as “restricted cash and cash equivalents”.

and $\$ 500$ million was repaid at maturity in January 2024 (see “Repayment of senior notes and related derivative settlements”).

In January 2023, we amended our revolving credit facility to further extend the maturity date of the $\$ 3$ billion tranche to January 2028, from April 2026, and the $\$ 1$ billion tranche to January 2026, from April 2024.

In 2022, we entered into a $\$ 665$ million senior unsecured non-revolving credit facility with a fixed $1 \%$ interest rate with Canada Infrastructure Bank. The credit facility can only be drawn upon to finance broadband service expansion projects to underserved communities under the Universal Broadband Fund. In 2023, we amended the terms of the facility to, among other things, increase the limit to $\$ 815$ million. As at December 31, 2023, we had not drawn on the credit facility.

1 Gross proceeds before transaction costs, discounts, and premiums. 2 Transaction costs, discounts, and premiums are included as deferred transaction costs and discounts in the carrying value of the long-term debt, and recognized in net income using the effective interest method. 3 Accounted for as a modification of the respective financial liabilities. Reflects initial consent fee of \$557 million incurred in September 2022 and additional consent fee of $\$ 262$ million incurred in December 2022. 4 Deferred transaction costs and discounts in the carrying value of the subordinated notes are recognized in net income using the effective interest method over a five-year period. The subordinated notes due 2082 can be redeemed at par on March 15, 2027 or on any subsequent interest payment date. 5 The US\$1 billion senior notes due 2025 can be redeemed at par on or after March 15, 2023.

Concurrent with the US dollar-denominated issuances, we entered into debt derivatives to convert all interest and principal payment obligations on the senior notes to Canadian dollars at a fixed interest rate. See “Financial Risk Management” for more information.

The issued senior and subordinated notes are unsecured and guaranteed by RCCI, ranking equally with all of our other unsecured senior notes and debentures, subordinated notes, bank credit facilities, and letter of credit facilities.

# 2023

In July 2023, we completed an offer to exchange the $\cup { \mathsf { S$ 7 . 0 5 } }$ billion of senior notes (Restricted Notes), which were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities

Act), for an equal principal amount of new notes registered under the Securities Act (Exchange Notes). The terms of the Exchange Notes are substantially identical to the terms of the corresponding Restricted Notes, except that the Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions applicable to the Restricted Notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes represent the same debt as the Restricted Notes and they were issued under the same indenture that governed the applicable series of Restricted Notes.

In September 2023, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $\$ 3$ billion. As a result, we received net proceeds of $\$ 2.98$ billion which we used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding debt.
