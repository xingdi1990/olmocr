verified that $g$ is an eub for $\vec { f } \mid \alpha _ { \xi }$ . But then $g$ witnesses that $\alpha _ { \xi }$ is good for $\bar { f }$ . Moreover, by construction, $\alpha _ { \xi } \in C$ . Since $C$ was arbitrary, we have shown that there are stationarily many elements of $S _ { \lambda } ^ { \lambda ^ { + 3 } }$ that are good for $\bar { f }$ .

By Theorem 12, it follows that there is an eub $h$ for $\bar { f }$ such that $\operatorname { c f } ( h ( i ) ) > \lambda$ for all $i < \omega$ .

Claim 14. cf $( h ( i ) ) \ge \lambda ^ { + 3 }$ for all but finitely many $i < \omega$ .

Proof. If not, then there exist $k \in \{ 1 , 2 \}$ and an unbounded $A \subseteq \omega$ such that, for all $i \in A$ , we have $\operatorname { c f } ( h ( i ) ) = \lambda ^ { + k }$ . For each $i \in A$ , let $\{ \delta _ { \eta } ^ { i } : \eta < \lambda ^ { + k } \}$ enumerate, in increasing fashion, a set of ordinals cofinal in $h ( i )$ . For each $\eta < \lambda ^ { + k }$ , define a function $h _ { \eta }$ from $\omega$ to the ordinals by letting $h _ { \eta } ( i ) = \delta _ { \eta } ^ { i }$ if $i \in A$ and $h _ { \eta } ( i ) = 0$ otherwise. For each $\eta < \lambda ^ { + k }$ , we have $h _ { \eta } < ^ { \ast } h$ , so, since $h$ is an eub for $\bar { f }$ , there is $\beta _ { \eta } < \lambda ^ { + 3 }$ such that $h _ { \eta } < ^ { \ast } ~ f _ { \beta _ { \eta } }$ . Let $\gamma = \operatorname* { s u p } \{ \beta _ { \eta } : \eta < \lambda ^ { + k } \}$ . Since $k < 3$ , we have $\gamma < \lambda ^ { + 3 }$ . Therefore, for all $\eta < \lambda ^ { + k }$ , we have $h _ { \eta } < ^ { \ast } ~ f _ { \gamma }$ . Fix an unbounded $B \subseteq \lambda ^ { + k }$ and an $n < \omega$ such that, for all $\eta \in B$ , we have $h _ { \eta } < _ { n } f _ { \gamma }$ . But then, for all $i \in A \setminus n$ , we must have $f _ { \gamma } ( i ) \geq \operatorname* { s u p } \{ \delta _ { \eta } ^ { i } : \eta \in B \} = h ( i )$ , contradicting the fact that $h$ is an upper bound for $\bar { f }$ .

But this claim immediately contradicts the fact that $\bar { f }$ is a sequence of functions from $\omega$ to $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon < \lambda ^ { + 3 }$ . This is because, by the claim, we must have $h ( i ) > \epsilon$ for all but finitely many $i < \omega$ . But then the constant function, taking value $\epsilon$ , witnesses that $h$ fails to be an eub.

The results in this section lead to the following corollary.

Corollary 15. Suppose that $3 \leq n < \omega$ .

1. If $\eta < \omega _ { n + 1 }$ , then there is no strongly increasing sequence $\langle f _ { \alpha } : \alpha < \omega _ { n + 1 } \rangle$ of functions from $\omega$ to $\eta$ .   
2. $( \aleph _ { \omega + 1 } , \aleph _ { \omega } ) \nrightarrow ( \aleph _ { n + 1 } , \aleph _ { n } )$ .   
3. There are no inner models $V \subseteq W$ of ZFC such that $( \aleph _ { \omega + 1 } ) ^ { V } = ( \aleph _ { n + 1 } ) ^ { W }$ .

It also follows that the only regular cardinals that can possibly be lengths of strongly increasing sequences from $\omega ^ { \omega }$ are $\aleph _ { n }$ for $0 \leq n \leq 3$ . We have seen that there are always such sequences of length $\aleph _ { 0 }$ and $\aleph _ { 1 }$ . We will prove, in Section 3, the consistency of the existence of a strongly increasing sequence of length $\aleph _ { 2 }$ . The question about the consistency of the existence of a strongly increasing sequence of length $\aleph _ { 3 }$ remains open.

# 3 Consistency via a $\mathbb { P } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ variation

In this section we use a natural variation of Woodinâ€™s partial order $\mathbb { P } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ to produce a very strongly increasing sequence in $\omega ^ { \omega }$ of length $\omega _ { 2 }$ .

We refer the reader to [14] for background on $\mathbb { P } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ , especially Chapter 4 and Section 9.2. The article [8] may also be helpful. Conditions in our partial order $\mathbb { P }$ are triples $( M , F , a )$ such that
