the crack tip for $\beta = 0$ . The greater the positive $\beta$ is, the higher the reduction is. Similar to Fig.   
4, all curves show slightly wavy patterns due to the impact of the density-dependent moduli.

Figure 6: $T _ { 2 2 }$ vs. $r$ ( $T _ { 2 2 }$ unit: $1 0 ^ { 4 }$ Pa). In the first panel, at $r = 0$ (the crack-tip), negative $\beta$ does not reduce $T _ { 2 2 }$ compared with $T _ { 2 2 }$ at $\beta = 0$ . Generally, a more negative value does not necessarily generate greater $T _ { 2 2 }$ at the crack tip. In the second panel for $\beta > 0$ , positive $\beta$ generates smaller $T _ { 2 2 }$ value compared with $T _ { 2 2 }$ at $\beta = 0$ . Greater $\beta$ creates smaller $T _ { 2 2 }$ at $r = 0$ . Slightly wavy patterns also appear in all the curves due to the effect of the density-dependent moduli.

# 5.3 SIF

For the current problem, we do not have an asymptotic or analytical solution. Therefore, an explicit description of crack-tip SIF is not available. However, one can utilize the crack-tip SIF defined for the linear elastic fracture mechanics model and use the finite element solution for the nonlinear model to glean some vital physical insight into SIF.

The SIF $K _ { I }$ in the context of linear elasticity defined as

$$
K _ { I } = \operatorname * { l i m } _ { r  0 ^ { + } } \sqrt { 2 \pi r } T _ { 2 2 } .
$$

It is challenging to analytically compute $K _ { I }$ for complicated models such as the ones in 3-D that we are investigating in this paper. We compute $K _ { I }$ numerically for illustrative purposes to understand its value as a function of the nonlinear modeling parameter $\beta$ . The function ${ \sqrt { 2 \pi r } } T _ { 2 2 }$ vs. $r$ is shown in Fig. 7. For $\beta = 0$ , $- 1 0$ , $- 2 0$ , $- 3 0$ , the $K _ { I }$ values are, respectively, 0.0110, 0.0185, 0.0251, 0.0178; For $\beta = 0$ , 10, 20, 30, the $K _ { I }$ values are, respectively, 0.0110, 0.0060, 0.0037, 0.0026 (Unit: $\mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 4 } m m ^ { 1 / 2 } P a }$ ). All the $K _ { I }$ values are very close, implying an identical theoretical $K _ { I }$ value for all $\beta$ is highly likely. Such numerical approximation for $K _ { I }$ shows that the nonlinear model with density-dependent moduli is designed appropriately under the common crack criteria used for the linear-elasticity fracture model. Also, in the two panels of Fig. 7, the curve shapes for $\beta < 0$ and $\beta > 0$ are slightly distinct. The $\beta < 0$ curves show a greater curvature, while those for $\beta > 0$ show flatter behaviors. Such difference is caused by the sign of $\beta$ , disclosing how negative and positive $\beta$ values impact the SIF differently.
