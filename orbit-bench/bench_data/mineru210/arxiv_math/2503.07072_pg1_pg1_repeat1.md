# Abstract

The problem of determining the maximum number of copies of $T$ in an $H$ -free graph, for any graphs $T$ and $H$ , was considered by Alon and Shikhelman. This is a variant of Tur´an’s classical extremal problem. We show lower and upper bounds for the maximum number of $s$ -cliques in a graph with no disjoint copies of arbitrary graph. We also determine the maximum number of $s$ -cliques in an $n$ -vertex graph that does not contain a disjoint union of $k$ paths of length two when $k = 2 , 3$ , or $s \geqslant k + 2$ , or $n$ is sufficiently large, this partly confirms a conjecture posed by Chen, Yang, Yuan, and Zhang [1].

# 1. Introduction

A graph $G$ is said to be $H$ -free if it does not contain any subgraph isomorphic to $H$ . The classical extremal function $\operatorname { e x } \left( n , H \right)$ denoted as $\operatorname { e x } ( n , H )$ , is formally defined as the maximum number of edges on an $n$ -vertex $H$ -free graph. This function extends naturally to a scenario where the objective is not merely to maximize the number of edges, but rather to maximize the number of copies of a specified graph $T$ within an $n$ -vertex graph that is $H$ -free. In accordance with the notation introduced by Alon and Shikhelman [2], the more general function is denoted as $\exp ( n , T , H )$ , which is commonly referred to the generalized Tur´an number of $H$ . Let $P _ { k }$ be the path with $k$ vertices. Obviously, $\operatorname { e x } ( n , P _ { 2 } , H ) = \operatorname { e x } ( n , H )$ . We denote the cycle with $\ell$ vertices by $C _ { \ell }$ and the complete graph with $s$ vertices by $K _ { s }$ .

The exploration of such problems dates back to the foundational work of Erd˝os [3], who established the values of $\mathrm { e x } ( n , K _ { s } , K _ { t } )$ for any two cliques. After these seminal discoveries, a series of related findings were made, with one of the most notable being the resolution of $\exp ( n , C _ { 5 } , C _ { 3 } )$ by Hatami et al. [4], and Grzesik [5], each working independently. A wealth of additional research has further expanded our understanding of generalized extremal numbers, as evidenced by various studies referenced in the literature [6, 7, 8, 9].

Scholars have studied the generalized Tur´an numbers for the vertex-disjoint union of graphs. Let $k H$ represent the collection of $k$ disjoint copies of the graph $H$ . Gerbner, Methuku, and Vizer [10] delved into the function $\mathrm { e x } ( n , T , k H )$ , where $H$
