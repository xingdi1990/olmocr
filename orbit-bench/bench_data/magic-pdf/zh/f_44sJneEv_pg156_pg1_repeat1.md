# 35. 財務風險管理  

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments in the normal course of the Group’s business are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.  

本集團金融工具於本集團業務一般過程中產生的主要風險為信貸風險、流動資金風險、利率風險及貨幣風險。  

# (a) Credit risk  

The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables and bank deposits. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposures to these credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.  

# (a) 信貸風險  

本集團的信貸風險主要來自貿易及其他應收款項及銀行存款。管理層已實行一項信貸政策，並持續監控該等信貸風險。  

In respect of trade and other receivables, individual credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. These evaluations focus on the customer’s past history of making payments when due and current ability to pay, and take into account information specific to the customers as well as pertaining to the economic environment in which the customers operate. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of trade customers. Trade receivables are due within 0-90 days from the date of billing. Normally, the Group does not obtain collateral from customers.  

就貿易及其他應收款項而言，對所有要求信貸額超過若干金額的客戶，必須進行個別信貸評估。此等信貸評估集中於客戶過往繳付到期款項之歷史及現時付款之能力，以及考慮到客戶之具體資料及客戶營運所在地之經濟環境。本集團持續對貿易客戶的財務狀況進行信貸評核。貿易應收款項自發票日期起計0至90日到期。通常，本集團並不向客戶收取抵押品。  

At the end of reporting period, the Group has a certain concentration of credit risk as $2 0 \%$ (2015: $1 6 \%$ ) and $4 4 \%$ (2015: $3 5 \%$ ) of the total trade and other receivables was due from one major customer and five largest customers respectively.  

於報告期末，本集團存在一定的信貸集中風險，因貿易及其他應收款項總額之 $2 0 \%$ （二零一五年： $1 6 \%$ ）及44%（二零一五年： $3 5 \%$ ）分別為應收自一名主要客戶及五大客戶。  

Substantial bank deposits are held in major financial institutions which management believes are of high credit quality.  

管理層認為，於主要金融機構持有的大部分銀行存款的信貸質素高。
