Impairment loss of financial assets (Continued)   
For financial assets measured at amortised cost，if,in a subsequent period, the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment losses was recognised， the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

財務資產之減值虧損（續）  

就以攤銷成本列值之財務資產而言，倘減值虧損款額於往後期間減少，而有關減少與確認減值虧損後發生的事項客觀相關，則過往確認之減值虧損將透過損益撥回，惟資產於減值撥回當日之脹面值不得超出並無確認減值所應有之攤銷成本。  

Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity investments will not be reversed in profit or loss in subsequent periods. Any increase in fair value subsequent to impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.For available-forsale debt investments， impairment losses are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the investment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.  

可供出售股本投資之減值虧損將不會於往後期間於損益撥回·確認減值虧損後出現之任何公允值增加於其他全面收益中確認·就可供出售債務投資而言，倘投資之公允值增加與確認減值虧損後出現事項客觀相關，則減值虧損其後將予以撥回。
