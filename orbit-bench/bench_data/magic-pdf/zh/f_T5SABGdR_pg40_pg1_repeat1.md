# AUDITORS'RESPONSIBILITY (COntinued)  

# 核數師之責任(續)  

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments，the auditorsconsider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors,as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  

審核涉及執行程式以獲取有關綜合財務報告所載金額及披露資料的審核憑證·所選定之程式須視乎核數師之判斷，包括評估綜合財務報告之重大錯誤陳述（不論是否因欺詐或錯誤引起)之風險·在作出該等風險評估時，核數師將考慮與公司編製及真實公平地呈列綜合財務報告有關之內部監控，以設計適當的審核程式，但並非旨在就實體內部監控是否有效發表意見·審核範圍亦包括評估所採用會計政策是否恰當及董事所作出之會計估算是否合理，以及對綜合財務報告之整體呈列方式作出評價。  

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  

吾等相信，吾等所獲得之審核憑證乃充足和適當地為吾等之審核意見提供基礎。
