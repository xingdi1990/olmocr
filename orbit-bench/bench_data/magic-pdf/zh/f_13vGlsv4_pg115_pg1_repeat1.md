(i) Impairment of investments in debt securities and receivables (Continued) If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment l o s s w a s re c o g n i s e d , t h e impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. A reversal of an impairment loss shall not result in the asset’s carrying amount exceeding that which would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.  

如於其後期間，減值虧損數額減少，而有關減少可客觀地與在確認減值虧損後發生的事件聯繫，則減值虧損會透過損益撥回。減值虧損撥回不得導致資產賬面值超出在過往年度並無確認減值虧損的情況下原應釐定的金額。  

For available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in the fair value reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss.  

有關可供出售金融資產，已於公平值儲 備 確 認 的 累 計虧損重新分類至損益。於損益確認的累計虧損金額為收購成本（扣除任何本金還款及攤銷）與當前公平值之差額減去先前於損益確認資產的任何減值虧損。  

Impairment losses in respect of available-for-sale debt securities are reversed if the subsequent increase in fair value can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Reversals of impairment losses in such circumstances are recognised in profit or loss.  

倘其後公平值增加客觀上與確認減值虧損後發生事件有關，則撥回可供出售債務證券的減值虧損。該等情況下的減值虧損撥回於損益確認。
