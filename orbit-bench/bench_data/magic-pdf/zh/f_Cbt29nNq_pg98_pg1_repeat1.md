# 31.PENDINGLITIGATION  

In HCA 1700/2011，since the legal representative of the Company filed the defence on behalf of the Company in December 2011，for almost 5 years，the Plaintiff has not taken any further steps at all in respect of the proceedings. The said law suit was taken out by Mr. Chan Ping Yee (the "Plaintiff"） and involves a dishonoured cheque issued by the Company for the amount of $\mathsf { H K } \$ 39,000,000$ allegedly payable to the Plaintiff. The Law suit came about because there was a possible share transaction which eventually fell through. It has always been the view of the Company's legal representative that the Plaintiff's claim is totally without ground. The Company had taken legal advice and has already given instructions to their legal representative to make an application to strike out the claim with costs，for(1） lack of merits of the claim，and (2）want of prosecution.Such application will be made in due course.  

# 31.待決訴訟  

有關HCA1700/2011號訴訟，自本公司法律代表代表本公司於二零一一年十二月入稟抗辯書以來，原告近五年以來並無就進行訴訟採取任何進一步行動·上述法律訴訟由Chan Ping Yee 先生（「原告」)提出，並涉及聲稱應向原告支付一張本公司發出的金額為39，000，000港元的未能承兑支票。產生該法律訴訟乃由於一項可能進行之股份交易最終告吹·本公司法律代表自始至終都認為原告的索償完全缺乏理據·鑑於(1)有關申索欠缺充分理據；及(2)訴訟程序中無人作出行動，本公司已徵詢法律意見並指示其法律代表申請撤銷該訴訟，訴訟費用由原告承擔·該申請將於適當時候發出。
