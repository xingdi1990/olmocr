# Report of the Directors董事會報告  

The Exclusive Technology Consultation and Service Agreements also provide that New Talent Media has the exclusive proprietary rights to all intellectual property rights developed or created during the performance of the Exclusive Technology Consultation and Service Agreements. The PRC Contractual Entities shall assign their intellectual property rights to New Talent Media upon request of New Talent Media. Our PRC Legal Adviser is of the opinion that (i) it is legal for New Talent Media to hold these intellectual property rights pursuant to the terms of the Exclusive Technology Consultation and Service Agreements; and (ii) that New Talent Media and the PRC Contractual Entities are not in violation of the requirements of Patent Law of the PRC, Trade Mark Law of PRC and Copyright Law of the PRC regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights.  

獨家技術諮詢和服務協議亦訂明聚視文化傳媒擁有於獨家技術諮詢和服務協議履行期間開發或創設的全部知識產權的獨家所有權。中國合約實體須於聚視文化傳媒要求時，轉讓彼等的知識產權予聚視文化傳媒。中國法律顧問認為，(i) 聚視文化傳媒根據獨家技術諮詢和服務協議的條款持有此等知識產權為合法；及(ii) 聚視文化傳媒及中國合約實體並無違反中國專利法、中國商標法及中國著作權法有關知識產權擁有權的規定。  

The relevant Exclusive Technology Consultation and Service Agreements have a term of ten years and will be automatically renewed for consecutive terms of one year upon expiry unless otherwise notified by New Talent Media. The relevant Exclusive Technology Consultation and Service Agreements shall be terminated prior to expiration in the event that (a) the business period of either New Talent Media or the PRC Contractual Entities expires or is terminated by any other reasons except that all right and obligation of New Talent Media under such agreements has been transferred to a third party (b) New Talent Media unilaterally terminates such agreements by advance written notice.  

獨家技術諮詢和服務協議的期限為十年且將於到期時自動續期一年，惟聚視文化傳媒另行通知則除外。倘(a) 聚視文化傳媒或中國合約實體的營業期限到期或因任何其他理由彼終止（除聚視文化傳媒於該等協議下的所有權利及義務已轉讓予第三方外）(b) 聚視文化傳媒單方面通過提前發出書面通知而終止該等協議，則相關獨家技術諮詢和服務協議於到期前將予終止。
