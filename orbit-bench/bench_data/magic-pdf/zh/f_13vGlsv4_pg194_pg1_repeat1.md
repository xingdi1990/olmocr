# Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)財務報表附註（續）  

(ExpresedinRenminbunles otherwiseindicated)（除另行指明者外，以人民幣列示）  

# 31 Possible impact of amendments, new standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2016  

(Continued)  

# 31 截至二零一六年十二月三十一日止年度已頒佈惟尚未生效的修訂、新訂準則及詮釋的可能影響（續）  

# IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers (Continued)  

# 國際財務報告準則第15號，來自客戶合約收益（續）  

(b) Significant financing component (Continued) Currently, the Group would only apply such a policy when payments are significantly deferred, which is currently not common in the Group’s arrangements with its customers. Currently, the Group does not apply such a policy when payments are received in advance.  

(b) 重大融資部分（續）  

目前，本集團僅於付款大幅延期時（目前本集團與其客戶間之安排中並不常見）採納此政策。目前，本集團並無於付款提前收取時採納此政策。  

The Group is in the process of assessing whether this component in the Group’s advance payment schemes would be significant to the contract and therefore whether, once IFRS 15 is adopted, the transaction price would need to be adjusted for the purposes of recognising revenue.  

本集團正在評估本集團提前付款計劃中之該部分是否對合約而言屬重大，及於國際財務報告準則第15號採納後，交易價格是否將因此須就確認收益而作出調整。  

# (c) Sales with a right of return  

Currently when the customers are allowed to return the products, the Group estimates the level of returns and makes an adjustment against revenue and cost of sales.  

# c) 具退貨權之銷售  

目前，當客戶被允許退回產品時，本集團會估計退貨水平並就收益及銷售成本作出調整。  

The Group expects that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not materially affect how the Group recognises revenue and cost of sales when the customers have a right of return. However, the new requirement to recognise separately a return asset for the products expected to be returned will impact the presentation in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group currently adjusts the carrying amounts of inventory for the expected returns, instead of recognising a separate asset.  

本集團預期採納國際財務報告準則第15號將不會對本集團於客戶有退貨權時確認收益及銷售成本之方式造成重大影響。然而，由於本集團目前就預期退貨對存貨賬面值進行調整而非另行確認資產，因此另行就預期將被退回之產品確認退回資產之新規定將影響於綜合財務狀況表之呈列。
