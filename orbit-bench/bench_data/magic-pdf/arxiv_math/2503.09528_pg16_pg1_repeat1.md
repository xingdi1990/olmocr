of Hausdorff the metric. With one missing digit, $\mathcal { C } _ { b , D }$ is $1 / N ^ { 1 / 2 } ( b )$ - close to $\ C _ { b , D _ { b } }$ . Notice that $\mathit { C } _ { b , D }$ is self-similar whose contraction ratio is $1 / N ^ { 1 / 2 } ( b )$ . From here, we see that the thickness of $\mathcal { C } _ { b , D }$ is at least $c _ { d } N ^ { 1 / 2 } ( b )$ for some constant $c _ { d } > 0$ . â–¡  

The thickness estimate holds for all $C _ { b , D , j }$ because of the self-similarity. However, we cannot directly use Theorem 11 to obtain intersections between different missing digit sets without checking the conditions (2,3).  

Consider different integers $b _ { 1 } , \ldots , b _ { k } \in \mathbb { Z } [ i ]$ with large enough norms so that Theorem 11 applies. Consider the logarithmic map  

$$
\log : a \in \mathbb { Z } [ i ] \to ( \log | a | , \arg a ) \in ( 0 , \infty ) \times \mathbb { T } .
$$  

The first component is the standard log for positive numbers. The second component is the argument of $a$ as a complex number.3 For simplicity, let us first look at the two integers $b _ { 1 } , b _ { 2 }$ . We claim that there are infinitely many positive rational integer pairs $( l _ { 1 } , l _ { 2 } )$ such that $b _ { 1 } ^ { l _ { 1 } } / b _ { 2 } ^ { l _ { 2 } }$ is close to one. In fact, consider the set  

$$
P = \{ b _ { 1 } ^ { l _ { 1 } } / b _ { 2 } ^ { l _ { 2 } } : ( l _ { 1 } , l _ { 2 } ) \in \mathbb { Z } _ { > 0 } ^ { 2 } \} \subset \mathbb { C } .
