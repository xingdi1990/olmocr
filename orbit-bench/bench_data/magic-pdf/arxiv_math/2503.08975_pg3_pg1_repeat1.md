Theorem 1.6 (Bars [5]). The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has infinitely many points of degree 2 over $\mathbb { Q }$ if and only if  

$$
N \in \{ 1 - 3 3 , 3 5 - 3 7 , 3 9 - 4 1 , 4 3 , 4 6 - 5 0 , 5 3 , 5 9 , 6 1 , 6 5 , 7 1 , 7 9 , 8 3 , 8 9 , 1 0 1 , 1 3 1 \}
$$  

Theorem 1.7 (Jeon [18]). The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has infinitely many points of degree 3 over $\mathbb { Q }$ if and only if  

$$
N \in \{ 1 - 2 9 , 3 1 , 3 2 , 3 4 , 3 6 , 3 7 , 4 3 , 4 5 , 4 9 , 5 0 , 5 4 , 6 4 , 8 1 \} .
$$  

Theorem 1.8 (Hwang, Jeon; Derickx, Orli´c [17, 11]). The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has infinitely many points of degree 4 over $\mathbb { Q }$ if and only if  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathrm { V } \in \{ 1 - 7 5 , 7 7 - 8 3 , 8 5 - 8 9 , 9 1 , 9 2 , 9 4 - 9 6 , 9 8 - 1 0 1 , 1 0 3 , 1 0 4 , 1 0 7 , 1 1 1 . } \\ & { \qquad \quad 1 1 8 , 1 1 9 , 1 2 1 , 1 2 3 , 1 2 5 , 1 2 8 , 1 3 1 , 1 4 1 - 1 4 3 , 1 4 5 , 1 5 5 , 1 5 9 , 1 6 7 , 1 9 1 \} . } \end{array}
$$  

From these results, it is easy to determine the modular curves of the form $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ with density degree 1, 2, 3 and 4. For example, $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has density degree 4 if and only if $N$ occurs in the set of Theorem 1.8 but not in the sets of Theorems 1.6 and 1.7. Motivated by the recent work of Kadets and Vogt [23] on density degrees, we determine all curves $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ with density degree equal to 5. Our main result is the following theorem:  

Theorem 1.9. The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has density degree $\operatorname* { m i n } ( \delta ( X _ { 0 } ( N ) / \mathbb { Q } ) ;$ equal to 5 if and only if $N = 1 0 9$ .  

This main theorem is an important step in determining all curves $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ with infinitely many quintic points. In fact, if a curve has infinitely many quintic points, then it has to have density degree $\leq 5$ . And our result completes the classification of all modular curves of density degree $\leq 5$ . So, in order to determine all curves $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ with infinitely many quintic points, it suffices to determine for the explicit list $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ of density degree $\leq 4$ whether they have infinitely many quintic points. With some extra work, we are able to prove the following:  

Theorem 1.10. The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has infinitely many points of degree 5 for  

$N \in \{ 1 - 4 5 , 4 7 - 5 8 , 6 1 , 6 3 , 6 4 , 6 5 , 6 7 , 6 8 , 7 2 , 7 3 , 7 5 , 8 0 , 8 1 , 9 1 , 1 0 9 , 1 2 1 , 1 2 5 \}$ .  

The modular curve $X _ { 0 } ( N )$ has only finitely many points of degree 5 for $N \geq 1 9 2$ and  

N ∈ {46, 59, 60, 62, 66, 69, 70, 71, 76, 78, 84, 87, 90, 93, 94, 95, 97, 102, 104, 105, $\begin{array} { r l r } & { } & { 1 0 6 , 1 0 8 , 1 1 0 , 1 1 2 - 1 1 7 , 1 1 9 , 1 2 0 , 1 2 2 , 1 2 4 , 1 2 6 , 1 2 7 , 1 2 9 , 1 3 0 , 1 3 2 - 1 4 0 , } \end{array}$ , $1 4 4 , 1 4 6 - 1 5 4 , 1 5 6 , 1 5 7 , 1 5 8 , 1 6 0 - 1 6 6 , 1 6 8 - 1 9 0 \} .$  

Remark 1.11. With the above theorem, there are 30 levels $N$ for which we do not know yet if there are infinitely many quintic points. These levels are  

{74, 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 92, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 107, 111, 118, 123, 128, 131, 141, 142, 143, 145, 155, 159, 167, 191}.
