Some key theoretical results behind the Gr¨obner walk are stated below. Detailed proofs and additional context may be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of [10].  

Theorem 2. For an ideal $I \triangleleft R$ , the following sets are in one-to-one correspondence:  

$$
\begin{array} { r } {  \begin{array} { c } { \mathrm { i n } _ { < } ( I ) , } \\ { < \textit { i s a t e r m o r d e r } } \end{array} \}  \{ \begin{array} { c } { \mathit { m a r k e d } G r \ddot { o b } \mathit { n e r } b a s e s } \\ { o f I } \end{array} \}  \{ \begin{array} { c } { \mathit { f u l l } - \mathit { d i m e n s i o n a l } } \\ { c o n e s \ o f \mathbb { G } ( I ) } \end{array} \} } \end{array}
$$  

In our setting, a marked Gr¨obner basis is a reduced Gr¨obner basis with the leading terms identified (formally, each $g$ is encoded as a pair $( g , x ^ { \alpha } )$ , where $x ^ { \alpha } = \operatorname { i n } _ { < } ( g )$ ). The first correspondence in Theorem 2 immediate, whilst the second correspondence is a consequence of [13, Theorem 1.11]: marked Gr¨obner bases encode the defining integer vectors of an H-description of the corresponding cone.  

Lower-dimensional cones in $\mathbb { G } ( I )$ correspond to generalized initial ideals $\mathrm { i n } _ { \omega } ( I )$ , where $\omega$ is any weight vector in the relative interior of said cone. Generically, such ideals are “almost monomial”, and may be retrieved with the help of the following lemma:  

Lemma 3. Let $G _ { < }$ be a marked Gro¨bner basis of $I$ with regards to $<$ and $\omega \in \mathbb { R } _ { \geq 0 } ^ { n }$ be a weight vector on the boundary of the corresponding cone in $\mathbb { G } ( I )$ . The set  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \operatorname { i n } _ { \omega } ( G _ { < } ) = \{ \operatorname* { i n } _ { \omega } ( g ) , g \in G _ { < } \} } \end{array}
$$  

is a marked Gr¨obner basis of $\mathrm { i n } _ { \omega } ( I )$ with respect to $<$ .  

At every step of the Gr¨obner walk, a basis of this form converted with Buchberger’s algorithm and then lifted to the basis of $I$ corresponding to the adjacent full-dimensional cone, which corresponds to $( < _ { t } ) _ { \omega }$ , i.e. the refinement of the target ordering $< _ { t }$ by $\omega$ .  

Lemma 4. Let $M = \{ m _ { 1 } , . . . , m _ { r } \}$ be the marked Gro¨bner basis of $\mathrm { i n } _ { \omega } ( I )$ with respect to the refinement ordering $( < _ { t } ) _ { \omega }$ . Then  

$$
G : = \{ m _ { 1 } - { \overline { { m _ { 1 } } } } ^ { G } < , . . . , m _ { r } - { \overline { { m _ { r } } } } ^ { G } < \}
$$  

is a Gr¨obner basis of $I$ with respect to $( < _ { t } ) _ { \omega }$ where $\overline { f } ^ { G _ { < } }$ denotes the normal form of $f$ with respect to the basis $G _ { < }$ .  

This process of subsequent passing to the generalized initial ideal and lifting to the adjacent basis is repeated until the target basis is computed.  

# 3. Functionality  

Our implementation of the Gr¨obner walk ships with OSCAR since version 1. 2. 0, thus it suffices to load OSCAR. There is a straightforward interface through the function groebner_walk.  

Example 5. Continuing from example Example 1, we can calculate a Gr¨obner basis of the ideal  

$$
I = \langle y ^ { 4 } + x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 } + x , x ^ { 4 } \rangle \triangleleft { \mathbb { Q } [ x , y ] }
$$  

with respect to $< _ { \mathrm { l e x } }$ by starting from a Gr¨obner basis for the graded reverse lexicographic ordering <degrevlex. Since $<$ <degrevlex is the default internal ordering of any polynomial ring in OSCAR, it suffices to call the Gr¨obner walk in the following way.
