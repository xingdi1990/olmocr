# 2 The Mandelstam Region  

A symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $S = [ s _ { i j } ]$ of rank $r$ is said to be a Mandelstam matrix if  

• the diagonal entries are non-negative, $s _ { i i } \geq 0$ for $i = 1 , \ldots , n$ ; and • it has precisely one positive eigenvalue and $r - 1$ negative eigenvalues.  

We denote the set of all Mandelstam matrices of rank $r$ by $\mathcal { M } _ { n , r }$ . This is a semialgebraic set in $\mathbb { R } ^ { \binom { n + 1 } { 2 } }$ , the space of all symmetric matrices. The following is the Mandelstam analogue of the familiar characterization of positive semidefinite matrices in terms of principal minors.  

Lemma 2.1. A symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $S$ is Mandelstam if and only if  

$$
( - 1 ) ^ { | I | - 1 } \operatorname * { d e t } ( S _ { I } ) ~ \geq ~ 0 \qquad f o r ~ a l l ~ I \subseteq [ n ] ,
$$  

where $\operatorname* { d e t } ( S _ { I } )$ are the principal minors of $S$ .  

Proof. This follows from the general results in [6]. We refer to Baker’s exposition in [3]. The key step is Cauchy’s interlacing theorem [12]. This states that the eigenvalues of $S _ { I }$ interlace the eigenvalues of $S _ { J }$ whenever $I \subset J$ . Hence, if $S _ { I }$ has at most one positive eigenvalue then so does $S _ { J }$ . But $S _ { J }$ cannot have all negative eigenvalues because its trace is non-negative.  

The name of our matrices refers to the physicist Stanley Mandelstam (1928–2016) who is credited for introducing the variables $s _ { i j }$ in the context of scattering amplitudes. In [14] the role of $\mathcal { M } _ { n , r }$ as a kinematic space is recognized. A term more familiar to mathematicians might be “Lorentzian matrices.” These encode Lorentzian quadratic forms [5, 6]. We here use the term Lorentzian matrix for a Mandelstam matrix whose entries $s _ { i j }$ are all non-negative.  

Mandelstam matrices arise as Gram matrices of momentum vectors in $\mathbb { R } ^ { 1 + d }$ with the Lorentzian inner product. A non-zero momentum vector is any vector $p \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 1 + d }$ of the form  

$$
p = \lambda ( 1 , x _ { 1 } , \ldots , x _ { d } ) ,
$$  

for some scalar $\lambda \neq 0$ , and $x = ( x _ { 1 } , \ldots , x _ { d } )$ in the closed unit ball $\mathbb { B } ^ { d } = \left\{ x \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d } : | | x | | \leq 1 \right\}$ . Given $n$ momentum vectors, $\boldsymbol { p } ^ { ( i ) }$ , their Gram matrix $\boldsymbol { S } = \left[ s _ { i j } \right]$ has entries $s _ { i j } = p ^ { ( i ) } \cdot p ^ { ( j ) }$ . This is the matrix in (1). The entries of $S$ may now be written as  

$$
s _ { i j } ~ = ~ \lambda _ { i } \lambda _ { j } \big ( 1 - \langle x ^ { ( i ) } , x ^ { ( j ) } \rangle \big )
$$  

Here is the Lorentz inner product on $\mathbb { R } ^ { 1 + d }$ and $\langle ~ , ~ \rangle$ is the Euclidean inner product on $\mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ .  

Lemma 2.2. A symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $S$ is Mandelstam, i.e. $S$ lies in the region $\mathcal { M } _ { n , \leq 1 + d }$ , if and only if it is the Gram matrix of n momentum vectors in $( 1 + d )$ -dimensional spacetime.  

Proof. Assume that $S$ has no zero rows or columns. For the only-if direction, take a Mandelstam matrix $S$ . By Lemma 2.1 and diagonalization of symmetric matrices, it can be factorized as in (1). Namely, we write $S = M D M ^ { \prime }$ , where $D = \operatorname { d i a g } ( 1 , - 1 , - 1 , . . . , - 1 )$ . Let the
