# About Sustainability and Social Impact Reporting  

# Transparent reporting  

The scope of our reporting on sustainability and social impact relates to Rogers Communications Inc.’s (RCI) operations in Canada. It summarizes our work in 2023 and the progress we have made in addressing our strategic priorities. On April 3, 2023, following the completion of our acquisition of Shaw Communications Inc. (Shaw and the Shaw Transaction, respectively), Shaw was amalgamated with RCI. The results from the acquired Shaw operations are included herein from the date of acquisition unless otherwise noted.  

We report key material topics related to sustainability and social impact on an annual basis. For 2023, we have combined this reporting into our Annual Report, highlighting our commitment to continue embedding sustainability and social impact into how we do business. This helps us to drive our business priorities while making a positive impact in the lives of Canadians.  

To guide our reporting, we consider the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the World Economic Forum (WEF), and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.  

Our 2023 reporting has been prepared based on internal criteria in recognition of the GRI Universal Standards, with reference to SASB reporting standards, and we consider our commitment to improve disclosure against the four pillars of TCFD. Refer to our 2023 Data Supplement at about.rogers.com/our-impact/impact-reports for our Index, Data Table, and Glossary of Terms. Please also refer to our 2023 Climate Action Report for our climate disclosures.
