We have had a solid year of leasing activity, negotiating 504 specialty leases, achieving fixed rent escalations of $4 . 8 \%$ across these deals and securing on average lease terms of 4.7 years.  

Strong demand for space across our portfolio has our occupancy sitting at $9 9 . 6 \%$ a 40 basis point improvement from 2015.  

We have seen an improvement in leasing spreads across the portfolio, with a number of assets, such as Rouse Hill Town Centre and Charlestown Square, reporting positive spreads.  

The lower churn and higher retention rate of $7 5 \%$ coupled with strong occupancy is enabling us to  drive growth in our specialty base rental line.  

The leasing market continues to see both domestic and international retailers seeking space, whilst the emergence of new retail concepts are also now creating demand. A great example of this is the first to market Kit Kat concept store at Melbourne Central.  

he demand for retail space, as evidenced through these results has remained strong, given our quality portfolio.
