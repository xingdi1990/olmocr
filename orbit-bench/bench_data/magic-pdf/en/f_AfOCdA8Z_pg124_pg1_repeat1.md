# 18 GOODWILL (CONTINUED)  

# Impairment tests for CGUs containing goodwill  

Goodwill is allocated to the Groupsâ€™ CGUs identified according to operating segment as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>In HK$ million</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>TSS</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Local telephony and data services</td><td>30,962</td><td>30,962</td></tr><tr><td>- Global</td><td>1,136</td><td>1,130</td></tr><tr><td>- Others</td><td>501</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile</td><td>16,853</td><td>16,853</td></tr><tr><td>Other Businesses</td><td>365</td><td>342</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>49,817</td><td>49,787</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using the estimated terminal growth rates stated below.  

The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations in 2015 and 2016 are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">2015</td><td colspan="3">2016</td></tr><tr><td>Operating margin</td><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>Discount rate</td><td>Operating margin</td><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>Discount rate</td></tr><tr><td>TSS</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Local telephony and data services</td><td>77%</td><td>1%</td><td>8%</td><td>77%</td><td>1%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>- Global</td><td>23%</td><td>3%</td><td>10%</td><td>22%</td><td>3%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile</td><td>46%</td><td>2%</td><td>10%</td><td>45%</td><td>2%</td><td>9%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU.  

There was no impairment required from the review on goodwill as at October 31, 2016.  

Management determined budgeted operating margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The terminal growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant CGUs.
