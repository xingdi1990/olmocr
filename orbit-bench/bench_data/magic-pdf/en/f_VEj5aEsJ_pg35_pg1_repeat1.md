# Theatre system maintenance  

Theatre system maintenance revenue increased $2 5 . 2 \%$ from $\mathsf { U S$ 9 9 . 3 }$ million in FY2015 to $\cup \ S \$ 11.7$ million in FY2016. Maintenance revenue increased in FY2016 commensurate with the increase in the number of theatres in the IMAX theatre network.  

# Film Business  

Revenue from our film business decreased $5 . 8 \%$ from $\cup \ S \$ 28.5$ million in FY2015 to $\cup \ S \$ 26.8$ million in FY2016, primarily due to a decrease in the box office revenue generated by IMAX films. The box office revenue generated by IMAX films decreased $5 . 3 \%$ from $\cup \ S \$ 312.4$ million in FY2015 to $\cup \mathtt { S P 2 9 5 . 7 }$ million in FY2016, as a result of lower box office revenue per screen. The overall PRC market on a same currency basis increased $3 . 7 \%$ from FY2015 to FY2016.  

Box office revenue per screen decreased $3 0 . 6 \%$ from $\cup \ S \$ 1.34$ million for FY2015 to $\cup \mathtt { S$ 0 .9 3 }$ million in FY2016 as a result of the strong performance of the Companyâ€™s film slate in FY2015, which included the top grossing Hollywood film of all time in China, Furious 7, along with Avengers Age of Ultron and Jurrassic World. The depreciation of the RMB relative to the USD also impacted recorded box office in FY2016 versus FY2015.
