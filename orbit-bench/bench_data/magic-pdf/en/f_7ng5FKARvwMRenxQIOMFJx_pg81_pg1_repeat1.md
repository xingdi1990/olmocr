# Ocumension License Agreement  

On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Ocumension (Hong Kong) Limited (“Ocumension HK”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ocumension, for the development and commercialization under Ocumension HK’s own brand name(s), either directly or through its affiliates or approved third-party sublicensees, of the Company’s 190 microgram fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant in applicator (the “Product,” currently marketed in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East as ILUVIEN) for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans, other than uveitis, in a specified territory. The Territory is defined as the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR, region of Taiwan, South Korea, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  

The Company received a nonrefundable upfront payment of $\$ 10.0$ million from Ocumension HK and may in the future receive additional salesbased milestone payments totaling up to $\$ 89.0$ million upon the achievements by Ocumension HK of certain specified sales milestones during the term of the License Agreement of the Product. The Company’s receipt of future milestone payments depends upon whether Ocumension HK is able to successfully complete product development and commercialization in the Territory, which requires, among other things, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and appropriate reimbursement pricing in the various countries and jurisdictions in the Territory, a process that may take several years. In 2021, the Company recognized $\$ 110$ million in license revenue from the Ocumension transaction (including the value of a warrant subscription agreement, which the Company received as consideration, to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Ocumension during a period of four years). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has approximately $\$ 0.4$ million and $\$ 0.3$ million, respectively, of deferred revenue under the Ocumension license agreement that will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement once Ocumension begins to sell the covered products under the license agreement.  

The term of the License will continue (a) until the 10th anniversary of the latest first commercial sale of the Product in any country or jurisdiction in the Territory or (b) for as long as Ocumension HK is commercializing the Product in any part of the Territory, whichever is later. The term is subject to the Company’s right to partially terminate the Agreement beginning on the 10th anniversary of the effective date with respect to any country or jurisdiction in the Territory in which Ocumension has not achieved at the time of termination first commercial sale and is not continuing to commercialize the Product. Ocumension will purchase Product from the Company at a fixed transfer price without royalty obligation on future sale (other than milestone payments as described above). Ocumension HK is responsible for all costs of development and commercialization in the Territory.
