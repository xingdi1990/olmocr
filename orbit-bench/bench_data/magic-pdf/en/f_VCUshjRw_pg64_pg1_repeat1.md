# Notes to the Financial Statements  

For the year ended 30 June 2016  

# 5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)  

# (b) Liquidity risk  

Individual operating entities within the Group are responsible for their own cash management, including the short term investment of cash surpluses and the raising of loans to cover expected cash demands, subject to the approval from board of directors. The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor current and expected liquidity requirements and its compliance with lending covenants to ensure that it maintains sufficient amount of cash and adequate committed lines of funding from major financial institutions to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term.  

The following table shows the remaining contractual maturities at the end of the reporting period of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities, based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest payments computed using contractual rates or, if floating, based on rates current at the end of the reporting period) and the earliest date the Group can be required to pay.  

Specifically, for term loan which contains a repayment on demand clause which can be exercised at the bank’s sole discretion, the analysis shows the cash outflow based on the contractual repayment schedule and, separately, the impact to the timing of the cash outflows if the lenders were to invoke their unconditional rights to call the loans with immediate effect.
