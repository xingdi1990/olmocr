Pursuant to our public offering, we offer shares of our common stock at the “transaction price,” plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The “transaction price” generally is equal to the net asset value (“NAV”) per share of our common stock most recently disclosed. Our NAV per share is calculated as of the last calendar day of each month for each of our outstanding classes of stock, and will be available generally within 15 calendar days after the end of the applicable month. Shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan are offered at the transaction price, as indicated above, in effect on the distribution date. We may update a previously disclosed transaction price in cases where we believe there has been a material change (positive or negative) to our NAV per share relative to the most recently disclosed monthly NAV per share.  

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $\$ 283.2$ million from the sale of approximately 18.9 million shares of our common stock in our ongoing public offering, including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan of approximately $\$ 85.2$ million.
