Short term incentive plan (STI)  

Short-term incentives are used to reward staff based on performance on a year by year basis. Rewards are made to participating key employees depending on the extent to which specific targets set at the beginning of the period are met. The targets relate to the earnings of the company and achievement of other KPIs aligned to the individual’s specific business function. The percentage and threshold level can differ for each individual and are reviewed each year. Payments are made in the form of cash and shares as determined at the discretion of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee. Shares are issued at the VWAP for the year. Benefits are pro-rated where employees join during an STI year. It is intended that key employees of the Group will be eligible to participate in the STI program. During the year all new and some existing participating key employees were migrated from the STI plan onto a new LTI scheme. See below under ‘Long term incentive plan’ and under Section C Service agreements.
