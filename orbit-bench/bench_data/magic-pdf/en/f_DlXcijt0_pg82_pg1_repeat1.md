# 3.4	 RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS  

Provisions for future removal and environmental restoration costs are recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of exploration, development, production, transportation or storage activities having been undertaken, and it is probable that future outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The estimated future obligations include the costs of removing facilities, abandoning wells and restoring the affected areas and is the best estimate of the present value of the future expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date, based on current legal requirements. Any changes in the estimate are reflected in the present value of the restoration provision at the reporting date, with a corresponding change in the cost of the associated asset. In the event the restoration provision is reduced, the cost of the related oil and gas asset is reduced by an amount not exceeding its an ng value. If the decrease in restoration provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately th income statement as other income.  

e amount of the provision for future restoration costs relating to exploration, development and production facilities is capitalised and pleted as a component of the cost of those activities.

# Significant judgement - Provision for restoration  

The Group estimates the future removal and restoration costs of oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines and related assets at the time of installation of the assets and reviews these assessments periodically. In most instances the removal of these assets will occur many years in the future. The estimate of future removal costs therefore requires management to make judgements regarding the removal date, future environmental legislation and the extent of restoration activities required.
